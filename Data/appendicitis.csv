"1","Prospective comparison of MR imaging and US for the diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis.","Radiology","PURPOSE: To prospectively compare nonenhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and ultrasonography (US) for the diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from the patient's parent or guardian. Eighty-one patients (34 male, 47 female; mean age, 12.3 years Â± 3.5 [standard deviation]; range, 4-17 years) were enrolled in this prospective study. All patients underwent right lower quadrant US and nonenhanced, nonsedated abdominopelvic MR imaging examinations. Two pediatric radiologists blinded to US results independently reviewed the MR images. MR imaging and US findings were designated positive, negative, or equivocal for acute appendicitis. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for MR imaging and US and compared by using two-sided McNemar test or the score statistics specified by Leisenring. Kappa statistics were generated to determine intertechnique agreement between MR imaging and US and interobserver agreement between the two primary MR imaging readers.<br />RESULTS: Thirty (37%) patients had pathologically proved acute appendicitis. When equivocal interpretations were designated positive, sensitivity was 93.3% for MR imaging (95% confidence interval [CI]: 77.9%, 99.2%) and 90.0% for US (95% CI: 73.5%, 97.9%), P > .99; specificity was 98% for MR imaging (95% CI: 89.6%, 100%) and 86.3% for US (95% CI:73.7%, 94.3%), P = .03; PPV was 96.5% for MR imaging (95% CI: 82.2%, 99.9%) and 79.4% for US (95% CI: 62.1%, 91.3%), P = .007; and NPV was 96.2% for MR imaging (95% CI: 86.8%, 99.5%) and 93.6% for US (95% CI: 82.4%, 98.7%), P = .45, with substantial intertechnique (Îº = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.63, 0.90) and interobserver (Îº = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.91) agreement. When equivocal interpretations were designated negative, MR imaging sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were unchanged. For US, sensitivity was 86.7% (95% CI: 69.3%, 96.2%), P = .5; specificity was 100% (95% CI: 93.0%, 100%), P > .99; PPV was 100% (95% CI: 86.8%, 100%), P = .31; and NPV was 92.7% (95% CI: 82.4%, 98.0%), P = .16, with almost perfect intertechnique (Îº = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.83, 1.00) and substantial interobserver (Îº = 0.72; 95% CI: 0.58, 0.87) agreement.<br />CONCLUSION: Nonenhanced MR imaging demonstrates high diagnostic performance similar to that of US for suspected pediatric appendicitis.","24646110","2014","7"

"3","Intraluminal appendiceal fluid is a predictive factor for recurrent appendicitis after initial successful non-operative management of uncomplicated appendicitis in pediatric patients.","Journal of pediatric surgery","BACKGROUND: The risk factors for recurrent appendicitis in pediatric patients are unclear. This study aimed to identify the predictive factors for recurrent appendicitis in pediatric patients who initially underwent successful non-operative management of uncomplicated appendicitis.<br />METHODS: Potential predictive factors for recurrent appendicitis in terms of clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography findings, were evaluated.<br />RESULTS: This study included 125 patients who underwent initial successful non-operative management of appendicitis. The rate of recurrent appendicitis was 19.2%, and the mean time to recurrence was 12.6 months. Univariate analyses found that rebound tenderness, muscle guarding, appendicoliths, appendiceal diameter >9 mm, and intraluminal appendiceal fluid were associated with recurrent appendicitis. Multivariate analysis identified only intraluminal appendiceal fluid as an independent predictor of recurrent appendicitis.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Intraluminal appendiceal fluid is a predictive factor for recurrent appendicitis after initial non-operative management. The results of this study provide valuable information that may help to determine the appropriate management during the first episode of appendicitis.","24952800","2014","7"
"4","A clinicopathological study of women with adnexal masses presenting with acute symptoms.","Annals of medical and health sciences research","BACKGROUND: Abdominal pain is one of the most common presentations of adnexal pathology in gynecology. Early diagnosis and intervention is essential especially in adolescent girls and reproductive age group women to conserve reproductive function.<br />AIM: The purpose of the following study is to assess the clinicopathologic outcome of women with adnexal masses presenting with acute pain.<br />SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of women with adnexal masses who had surgical intervention for acute symptoms from June 2007 to May 2012 was undertaken. During the study period, a total of 57 women were operated for adnexal masses as emergency.<br />RESULTS: Of the 57 women operated for adnexal masses as emergency, the most common pathology was teratoma 26% (15/57) followed by corpus luteal hemorrhage (16%) and endometriosis (14%). Laparoscopy was the initial surgical approach in just over 50% of patients, but surgery was completed laparoscopically only in about one-third of patients. Conservative surgery in the form of ovarian cystectomy was possible in 70% of patients.<br />CONCLUSION: Complications of adnexal masses such as torsion and hemorrhage are common causes of acute abdominal pain. Timely diagnosis of the adnexal pathology and surgical intervention will help to preserve the reproductive outcome. Conservative surgery was possible in 70% of our study group.","24761256","2014","3"
"5","Outcomes and cost analysis of laparoscopic versus open appendectomy for treatment of acute appendicitis: 4-years experience in a district hospital.","BMC surgery","BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic appendectomy is not yet unanimously considered the \"gold standard\" in the treatment of acute appendicitis because of its higher operative time, intra-abdominal abscess risk, and costs compared to open appendectomy. This study aimed to compare outcomes and cost of laparoscopic and open appendectomy in a district hospital.<br />METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 230 patients who underwent appendectomy at the Division of General Surgery of the Civil Hospital of Ragusa, Italy, from May 2008 to May 2012 was performed. The variables analyzed included patients data (age, gender, previous abdominal surgery, preoperative WBC count, duration of symptoms, ASA risk score), rate of uncomplicated or complicated appendicitis, operative time, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, and total costs. The patients were divided in two groups according to the surgical approach and compared for each variable. The results were analyzed using the t Student test for quantitative variables, and the Chi-square test with Yates correction and Fisher exact test for categorical.<br />RESULTS: Laparoscopic appendectomy was performed in 139 patients, open appendectomy in 91. Two cases (1.4%) were converted to open procedure and included in the laparoscopic group data. Patient data and rate of complicated appendicitis were similar in the two study groups. There was no statistical difference (pâ€‰=â€‰0.476) in the mean operative time between the laparoscopic (52.2 min; range, 20-155) and open appendectomy (49.3 min; range, 20-110) groups. The overall incidence of minor and major complications was significantly lower (pâ€‰=â€‰0.006) after laparoscopic appendectomy (2.9%, 4 cases) than after open appendectomy (13.2%, 12 cases); rate of intra-abdominal abscess were similar. The length of hospital stay was significantly shorter (pâ€‰=â€‰0.001) in laparoscopic group (2.75 days; range, 1-8) than in open group (3.87 days; range, 1-19). The mean total cost was 2282 Euro in laparoscopic group and 2337 Euro in open group, with a no significant difference of 55 Euro (pâ€‰=â€‰0.812).<br />CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic appendectomy is associated with fewer complications, shorter hospital stay, and similar operative time, intra-abdominal abscess rate, and total costs, compared with open appendectomy. Therefore, laparoscopic appendectomy can be recommended as preferred approach in acute appendicitis.","24646120","2014",\N
"6","Expression and significance of toll-like receptor 2,4 of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in acute abdomen patients associated with systemic inflammatory response syndrome.","Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Medical sciences = Hua zhong ke ji da xue xue bao. Yi xue Ying De wen ban = Huazhong keji daxue xuebao. Yixue Yingdewen ban","The changes of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, 4 of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the acute abdomen patients associated with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and their potential significance were explored. A clinical study was performed on 103 acute abdomen patients in whom 65 were associated with SIRS. Forty healthy individuals served as normal controls. The mRNA expression of TLR2, 4 was detected by RT-PCR, and the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-6 by ELISA. The level of plasma endotoxin, hospital stay and mortality were measured. It was found that the endotoxin level was increased to varying degrees in all the acute abdomen patients, and the endotoxin level was and hospital stay longer in SIRS group than in non-SIRS group (P<0.01). TLR2 mRNA, TLR4 mRNA, IL-6 and TNF-alpha could be detected with low value in normal controls, but they were up-regulated markedly on the 1st day after admission. Then TLR4 mRNA, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were decreased gradually, but TLR2 mRNA maintained at a high level till the 5th day. These indexes above in SIRS group were higher than those in non-SIRS group (P<0.01). The results of correlation analysis revealed the expression of TLR2, 4 mRNA was positively correlated with the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6, and the hospital stay. The results of Logistic regression demonstrated that overexpression of TLR2, 4 mRNA might result in higher risk of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). It was concluded that in the acute abdomen patients associated with SIRS, the expression of TLR2, 4 in PBMCs was increased markedly, suggesting that TLR might play an important role in the pathogenesis of acute abdomen associated with SIRS.","17219971","2006",\N
"7","The experience of transumbilical endoscopic appendectomies.","Annals of surgical treatment and research","Minimally invasive surgery is being widely accepted in various fields of surgery. Although several appendectomy techniques have been reported but, there is no standardization. We report here the experiences of transumbilical endoscopic appendectomy in humans. Between July 2008 and September 2010, ten patients with appendicitis successfully underwent transumbilical endoscopic appendectomies. There were 7 cases of suppurative, 2 cases of gangrenous and 1 case of perforated in operative findings. The ages of the patients were 13-56 years (mean age, 32.7 Â± 15.4 years). Under general anesthesia, a 15-mm port was inserted through the umbilicus and then a two-channel endoscope was inserted in the peritoneal cavity. After appendix identification, counter-traction of the appendix with a direct abdominal wall puncture using a straight round needle prolene was performed to achieve good visualization of the operative field. Tissue dissection was performed using an endoscopic needle knife. Tissue grasping and resected appendix retrieval were done with endoscopic forceps. The average operation time was 79.5 Â± 23.6 minutes (range, 45 to 110 minutes). No procedures were converted to laparoscopic or open appendectomy. Hospital stay was 4-6 days. All patients completely recovered without complications. As it is highly maneuverable, we believe transumbilical endoscopic appendectomy can be a feasible method. And, as surgeons want to proceed from laparoscopic surgery to natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery, this procedure could be a triable method.","24851231","2014","5"
"8","Utility of immature granulocyte percentage in pediatric appendicitis.","The Journal of surgical research","BACKGROUND: Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of abdominal surgery in children. Adjuncts are used to help clinicians predict acute or perforated appendicitis, which may affect treatment decisions. Automated hematologic analyzers can perform more accurate automated differentials including immature granulocyte percentages (IG%). Elevated IG% has demonstrated improved accuracy for predicting sepsis in the neonatal population than traditional immature-to-total neutrophil count ratios. We intended to assess the additional discriminatory ability of IG% to traditionally assessed parameters in the differentiation between acute and perforated appendicitis.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified all patients with appendicitis from July 2012-June 2013 by International Classification of Diseases-9 code. Charts were reviewed for relevant demographic, clinical, and outcome data, which were compared between acute and perforated appendicitis groups using Fisher exact and t-tests for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. We used an adjusted logistic regression model using clinical laboratory values to predict the odds of perforated appendicitis.<br />RESULTS: A total of 251 patients were included in the analysis. Those with perforated appendicitis had a higher white blood cell count (P=0.0063), C-reactive protein (CRP) (P<0.0001), and IG% (P=0.0299). In the adjusted model, only elevated CRP (odds ratio 3.46, 95% confidence interval 1.40-8.54) and presence of left shift (odds ratio 2.66, 95% confidence interval 1.09-6.46) were significant predictors of perforated appendicitis. The c-statistic of the final model was 0.70, suggesting fair discriminatory ability in predicting perforated appendicitis.<br />CONCLUSIONS: IG% did not provide any additional benefit to elevated CRP and presence of left shift in the differentiation between acute and perforated appendicitis.","24793450","2014","7"
"9","Cost-effectiveness of preoperative imaging for appendicitis after indeterminate ultrasonography in the second or third trimester of pregnancy.","Obstetrics and gynecology","OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic laparoscopy, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after indeterminate ultrasonography in pregnant women with suspected appendicitis.<br />METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to simulate appendicitis during pregnancy taking into consideration the health outcomes for both the pregnant women and developing fetuses. Strategies included diagnostic laparoscopy, CT, and MRI. Outcomes included positive appendectomy, negative appendectomy, maternal perioperative complications, preterm delivery, fetal loss, childhood cancer, lifetime costs, discounted life expectancy, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.<br />RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging is the most cost-effective strategy, costing $6,767 per quality-adjusted life-year gained relative to CT, well below the generally accepted $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year threshold. In a setting where MRI is unavailable, CT is cost-effective even when considering the increased risk of radiation-associated childhood cancer ($560 per quality-adjusted life-year gained relative to diagnostic laparoscopy). Unless the negative appendectomy rate is less than 1%, imaging of any type is more cost-effective than proceeding directly to diagnostic laparoscopy.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Depending on imaging costs and resource availability, both CT and MRI are potentially cost-effective. The risk of radiation-associated childhood cancer from CT has little effect on population-level outcomes or cost-effectiveness but is a concern for individual patients. For pregnant women with suspected appendicitis, an extremely high level of clinical diagnostic certainty must be reached before proceeding to operation without preoperative imaging.","24084540","2013","10"
"10","An evaluation of operative self-assessment by UK postgraduate trainees.","Medical teacher","BACKGROUND: Surgeons in training undertake procedure-based assessment (PBA) with their trainers. Time pressures limit when this occurs. Self-assessment would provide additional opportunities but requires evaluation of your own skills and knowledge.<br />AIM: To investigate the validity of a self-assessment PBA in the operating theatre and evaluate learning needs and change in practice identified.<br />METHODS: In a prospective study, postgraduate UK trainees performed a self-assessment PBA after formally reflecting on appendicectomy surgery. Later, they performed their usual external assessment PBA on the same case and outcomes were compared. Learning outcomes were analysed independently by two trainers.<br />RESULTS: There were 25 trainees (14 males), of age 29 years (25-33). They had performed a median of five previous appendicectomies (2-21) after a median three years of speciality training (range 1-4). There were no significant differences in global summary scores, trainee satisfaction or learning outcomes between external and self-assessment PBAs. Construct validity of the self-assessment PBA was demonstrated. The self-assessment PBA was more likely to identify non-technical skills.<br />CONCLUSION: Our results suggest self-assessment PBA is valid for formative assessment. It identified a wide range of learning outcomes. Self-assessment PBA would help trainees maximise every learning opportunity and practice self-assessment skills.","24152186","2014","1"
"11","How reliable is the Alvarado score in acute appendicitis?","Ulusal travma ve acil cerrahi dergisi = Turkish journal of trauma & emergency surgery : TJTES","BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the reliability of the Alvarado score (AS) in determining acute appendicitis and the different parameters that affect the AS.<br />METHODS: Three hundred and thirteen patients suspected of acute appendicitis (AA) aged 18-70 years were included in this study. Patient data including AS calculated from emergency services and at discharge, follow-up, and operations were recorded. Patients were divided into three groups according to the AS, as AS <4, AS 5-7 and AS 8-10. AA and appendicitis perforation rates were compared according to the different parameters.<br />RESULTS: The mean age of patients (55% females, 45% males) was 30.8Â±10.8 years. The AA (appendix perforation) rates of 211 patients who underwent operation were found as: AS â‰¤4: 56.5% (7.7%), AS 5-7: 75.9% (10%), and AS 8-10: 89% (27.8%). The percentage of negative appendectomy was 19.4%. The scoring was more reliable in males with AS 5-7, and the reliability weakened as body mass index (BMI) increased in all groups.<br />CONCLUSION: Patients with AS â‰¤4 must be followed up and should be informed at the time of their discharge about the slight possibility of appendicitis. The effect of AS in determining the diagnosis of appendicitis is not influenced by age or symptom duration.","24639309","2014","1"

"13","[The role of the computed tomography in the identification of the syndrome of pelvic congestion].","GinecologÃ­a y obstetricia de MÃ©xico","BACKGROUND: Pelvic congestion syndrome is a condition not yet fully understood, hence provokes controversy. It is cause of up to 40% of visits to the doctor; affecting women of reproductive age who experience non-specific symptoms such as characteristic pelvic pain with more than six months of evolution and difficult to treat dyspareunia in which even narcotics are insufficient for control.<br />OBJECTIVE: To recognize the vascular anatomy of the pelvic cavity and identify the characteristics of pelvic congestion syndrome demonstrable by computed tomography.<br />MATERIAL AND METHODS: A descriptive, observational, cross-sectional and retrospective study at Hospital Angeles del Pedregal, in the Department of Radiology and Imaging with patients who reported imaging studies with key findings to recognize the pelvic congestion syndrome. All women with incidental finding of abnormal dilation of the gonadal vein were included, allowing to suggest pelvic congestion syndrome as a possible diagnosis.<br />RESULTS: There were 17 cases (0.9%) of patients with abdominopelvic pain syndrome who underwent multislice computed tomography to 3 mm, with extension from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis. Predominance of left gonadal vein is conditioned by the anatomical arrangement of the left gonadal vein. During the arterial phase opacification of the gonadal vein was identified in 11 patients (65%), a circumstance that correlates with retrograde venous flow valve incompetence. In computed tomography findings of pelvic congestion syndrome were also identified 12 patients (70%) with abdominopelvic pain syndrome.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Pelvic congestion syndrome is a rare condition that radiologists do not consider because they don't know it and the clinical diagnoses give no clinical data to suggest this condition. But if one takes into account the literature, it refers to it as the origin of up to 40% of the visits to the gynecologist, and there may be more cases that will increase its prevalence.","23971386","2013","7"

An international evaluation of methods.","International journal of surgery (London, England)","INTRODUCTION: Considerable variability exists in the diagnostic approach to acute appendicitis (in children), affecting both quality and costs of care. Interestingly, an international evaluation of what is commonly practiced today has not been performed. We aimed to document current practice patterns in the diagnosis of appendicitis in children and to determine whether a consensus exists in the workup of these patients among Canadian, Dutch, and Saudi Arabian pediatric surgeons.<br />METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional survey using a pre-designed, self-administered, 14-item survey. We sent the survey to participants via electronic mail.<br />RESULTS: In total, 83 responses were received and analyzed, yielding a response rate of 42%. The majority of respondents practiced at pediatric surgery centers with over 50 beds (58% of Canadian surgeons, 81% of Dutch surgeons, 93% of Saudi Arabian surgeons). The majority of Dutch surgeons had a preference for physical examination and radiological imaging as opposed to Canadian and Saudi Arabian surgeons who favored history and physical examination. Interestingly, only one of the surgeons surveyed used an appendicitis scoring system. Regarding history and physical examination, most respondents deemed migratory abdominal pain and localized RLQ tenderness to be most suggestive of appendicitis. Ultrasound was the most preferable imaging modality in acute appendicitis across all three countries.<br />CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that international pediatric surgeons vary substantially in the diagnostic workup of patients with appendicitis. Furthermore, there is a variability between common practice and the current evidence. We recommend that pediatric surgeons develop clinical practice guidelines that are based on consensus information (expert opinion) and the best available literature.","24211647","2014",\N

In the published literature, graded-compression Ultrasound has shown an extremely variable diagnostic accuracy in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis (sensitivity range from 44% to 100%; specificity range from 47% to 99% ). This is due to many reasons, including lack of operator skill, increased bowel gas content, obesity, anatomic variants, and limitations to explore patients with previuos laparotomies.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Graded-compression Ultrasound still remains our first-line method in patients referred with clinically suspected acute appendicitis: nevertheless, due to variable diagnostic accuracy, individual skill is requested not only to perform a successful exam, but also in order to triage those equivocal cases that, subsequently, will have to undergo assessment by means of Computed Tomography.","23902717","2013","7"
"18","Clinical presentation of acute appendicitis in adults at the Chris Hani Baragwanath academic hospital.","International journal of emergency medicine","BACKGROUND: Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical abdominal emergency. Delayed treatment increases the incidence of complications. The aim of this study was to investigate the presentation, incidence, and predictors of complications, and histological findings in adult patients with clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis.<br />METHODS: The study was a prospective observational study and included patients aged 12Â years and older diagnosed with acute appendicitis. Data collected included demographic data, clinical presentation, duration of symptoms and reasons for presentation delay, diagnostic investigations, operative and histology findings, length of hospital stay, and mortality.<br />RESULTS: A total of 146 patients were admitted with a mean age of 26Â years (SDâ€‰=â€‰12Â years). The male to female ratio was 1.6:1. Predominant presenting symptoms were right iliac fossa pain (95%), nausea (80%), and vomiting (73%), with 63% of patients presenting 2Â days after onset of symptoms. Fever was present in 15% and only 31% of patients gave a typical history of acute appendicitis of vague peri-umbilical pain. The negative predictive values of white cell count and C-reactive protein for acute appendicitis were 28% and 50%, respectively. Sensitivity of the ultrasound to detect acute appendicitis was 60% with a negative predictive value of 31%; 30% of patients had complicated appendicitis. Histology results showed a normal appendix in 11% of patients. The 30-day mortality rate was 1.4%.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Patients with acute appendicitis rarely present with a typical history of vague peri-umbilical pain. The negative predictive values of both white cell count and ultrasound proved that neither of these measurements was accurate in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Most of our patients with complicated disease present late, with the most common reasons for this delay being lack of access to a medical clinics and prior treatment by general practitioners. Complications were higher in males and in those aged 45Â years and above.","24533851","2014",\N
"19","Bilirubin; a diagnostic marker for appendicitis.","International journal of surgery (London, England)","INTRODUCTION: Every investigation that can contribute towards a diagnosis of appendicitis is valuable to the emergency general surgeon. Previous research has suggested that hyperbilirubinaemia is a more specific marker for both simple and perforated appendicitis than WBC (white blood count) and CRP (C-reactive protein), but this investigation is not commonly used to help diagnose appendicitis.<br />AIMS: This study investigated whether there is an association between hyperbilirubinaemia and appendicitis. We also reviewed the diagnostic value of bilirubin in perforated vs simple appendicitis, and compared it with the serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC).<br />METHODS: This single centre, prospective observational study included all patients admitted with right iliac fossa (RIF) pain who had liver function tests performed. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test to compare bilirubin, WBC and CRP levels for normal appendices, simple appendicitis, and perforated appendicitis.<br />RESULTS: 242 patients were included in this study, of whom 143 were managed operatively for RIF pain. Hyperbilirubinaemia was significantly associated with appendicitis vs RIF pain of other aetiologies (p < 0.0001). Bilirubin had a higher specificity (0.96), than WBC (0.71) and CRP (0.62), but a lower sensitivity (0.27 vs 0.68 and 0.82 respectively). Hyperbilirubinaemia was associated with perforated appendicitis vs simple appendicitis with statistical significance (p < 0.0001). Bilirubin had a higher specificity (0.82) than both WBC (0.34) and CRP (0.21), but a lower sensitivity (0.70 vs 0.80 and 0.95 respectively).<br />CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm that hyperbilirubinaemia has a high specificity for distinguishing acute appendicitis, especially when perforated, from other causes of RIF pain, particularly those not requiring surgery.","24080115","2013",\N

Patients were categorized into three groups retrospectively based on the Alvarado score. Group I: score 7-10 (n = 155), group II: score 4-6 (n = 71), group III: score less than 3 (n = 10). Negative (NPV) and positive predictive values (PPV) of CRP was calculated.<br />RESULTS: Overall, 169 of 234 (72.2%) had histopathological confirmation of acute appendicitis. The predicted accuracy of Alvarado score was 84.5% in group I, 50.7% in group II and 25% in group III. The PPV of high CRP and NPV of normal CRP for group I was 88% and 36.4%, in group II, 63% and 72%, in group III, 33% and 86%, respectively.<br />CONCLUSION: The Alvarado score and CRP taken together improve the predictive value of diagnosing acute appendicitis.

Expert reading was performed by two radiologists with a larger abdominal MR experience (>500 examinations) in consensus. A final diagnosis was assigned after three months based on all available information, except MRI findings. We estimated MRI sensitivity and specificity for appendicitis and for all urgent diagnoses separately. Interobserver agreement was evaluated using kappa statistics.<br />RESULTS: Urgent diagnoses were assigned to 147 of 223 patients; 117 had appendicitis. Sensitivity for appendicitis was 0.89 by MR-non-expert radiologists and 0.97 in MR-expert reading (p=0.01). Specificity was 0.83 for MR-non-experts versus 0.93 for MR-expert reading (p=0.002). MR-experts and MR-non-experts agreed on appendicitis in 89% of cases (kappa 0.78). Accuracy in detecting urgent diagnoses was significantly lower in MR-non-experts compared to MR-expert reading: sensitivity 0.84 versus 0.95 (p<0.001) and specificity 0.71 versus 0.82 (p=0.03), respectively. Agreement on urgent diagnoses was 83% (kappa 0.63).<br />CONCLUSION: MR-non-experts have sufficient sensitivity in reading MRI in patients with suspected appendicitis, with good agreement with MR-expert reading, but accuracy of MR-expert reading was higher.","24168926","2014","1"

Suspicious right lower quadrant pains are sometimes a problem for pediatric surgeons. In this study, we wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of laparoscopy in diagnosis and treatment of children with suspicion of abdominal pain.<br />METHODS: The files of 84 patients treated with a diagnosis of suspicious right lower quadrant peritonitis between 2005 and 2011 were investigated. Laparoscopic exploration was performed for all cases with right lower quadrant pain where the appendix was not seen on USG/CT and the cause of acute abdomen could not be determined.<br />RESULTS: In this process, 84 patients consisting of 60 (71%) females and 24 (29%) males were included in the study. The mean age was 10.5 years (7-16 years). Appendicitis was determined during diagnostic laparoscopy in 35 (41.6%) patients. The appendix was normal in the remaining 49 (58.3%) patients. In 36 of these patients, gynecological diseases were encountered on pathology as the most frequent cause of the acute abdomen. The appendix was preserved in patients where the cause of the abdominal pain was explained.<br />CONCLUSION: Laparoscopy can be used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with suspected acute abdomen that imitates acute appendicitis and cannot be differentiated with physical examination and laboratory methods. Delays in diagnosis and unnecessary appendectomy will be prevented in this way.","24353684","2013","7"

"24","Efficacy of POSSUM score in predicting the outcome in patients undergoing emergency laparotomy.","Polski przeglad chirurgiczny","UNLABELLED: Monitoring of surgical outcome is increasingly important part of governance of surgical activity.<br />THE AIM OF THE STUDY: POSSUM scoring system was applied prospectively to determine how it performed in predicting morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing emergency laparotomy in our hospital, a group known to be at high risk of complications and death.<br />MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 100 cases of emergency laparotomies were studied in patients admitted in general surgery department during the period of May 2008 to August 2010. The study group consisted of the following cases. Duodenal perforation (37 cases), intestinal obstruction (27 cases), gastric perforation (8 cases), ileal perforation (8 cases), appendicular perforation (7 cases), blunt trauma (4 cases) and others (9 cases). They were scored using POSSUM scoring system. Physiological scoring was done at the time of admission and operative scoring was done intraoperatively. They were followed up for the first 30 day post operative period for any complications and the outcome was noted. The observed morbidity and mortality rates were compared with the POSSUM predicted morbidity and mortality rates.<br />RESULTS: 15 patients died (mortality rate of 15%). The POSSUM predicted mortality was 20 deaths. O:E ratio of 0.71 was obtained. There was no statistically significant difference between the observed and predicted mortality rates (Ï‡Â²=1.72, p=0.974). 71 patients experienced complications. The POSSUM predicted morbidity was 61 patients. O:E ratio of 1.19 was obtained. There was no statistically significant difference between the observed and predicted morbidity rates (Ï‡Â²=1.594, p=0.991).<br />CONCLUSIONS: POSSUM scoring is an accurate predictor of mortality and morbidity following emergency laparotomy and is a valid means of assessing adequacy of care provided to the patient. POSSUM can be used for surgical audit to assess and improve the quality of surgical care and helps in better outcome to the patient.","24988229","2014","4"

The goal of this study was to determine whether Alvarado scores can be used to aid in the accurate diagnosis of appendicitis.<br />METHODS: Alvarado score evaluations were performed on 300 patients that were referred to or presented to the emergency room with acute abdominal pain.<br />RESULTS: Out of the 300 patients, 85.66% had Alvarado scores of 7 or less and 14.33% had Alvarado scores greater than 7. For patients that had confirmed appendicitis, 25.7% had Alvarado scores of 7 or less, whereas 93% had Alvarado scores greater than 7. The Alvarado scoring system had poor sensitivity at 37%, and the specificity of this scoring system was high at 95%.<br />CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that patients presenting with abdominal pain and Alvarado scores greater than 7 are more likely to have appendicitis. As such, the Alvarado scoring system may be utilized to better predict whether a patient has appendicitis. An Alvarado score that is positive for appendicitis would consist of a score greater than 7, which suggests that the patient has a 93% chance of having appendicitis. A negative Alvarado score is 7 or lower, suggesting a 26% probability of having appendicitis. In all, the Alvarado scoring system is a good rule-in test, but it does not adequately rule-out appendicitis.","24740332","2014","3"
"26","Ultrasound evaluation of appendicitis: importance of the 3 Ã— 2 table for outcome reporting.","The American journal of emergency medicine","INTRODUCTION: Despite a relatively high frequency of appendix nonvisualization when using ultrasound to diagnose appendicitis, many studies either fail to report these results or inconsistently analyze outcomes.<br />OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to determine the most transparent and accurate way of reporting and analyzing ultrasound results for the diagnosis of appendicitis.<br />METHODS: This was an observational cohort study of emergency department patients age 18 years or older who underwent right lower quadrant ultrasonography from September 2010 to October 2011. Patient characteristics, imaging, pathology, and follow-up data were analyzed. Test characteristics were calculated using conventional 2 Ã— 2 contingency table analysis excluding inconclusive ultrasound results and an intention-to-diagnose approach with a 3 Ã— 2 table.<br />RESULTS: Sixty-five patients were included. Forty-four (68%) patients had a nonvisualized appendix resulting in an overall diagnostic yield of 32%. Twenty-one patients had a visualized appendix (14 [22%] negative and 7 [11%] positive for appendicitis). Using 2 Ã— 2 contingency table analysis, sensitivity and specificity were 100%. Using the 3 Ã— 2 table with and the intention-to-diagnose principle, sensitivity was 70% and specificity was 25%. Three (7%) of 44 patients with a nonvisualized appendix had appendicitis (likelihood ratio = 0.40).<br />DISCUSSION: We suggest reporting ultrasound results using a 3 Ã— 2 table (including nonvisualized findings) but using the traditional 2 Ã— 2 type of analysis for test characteristic calculations. This approach allows for the determination of diagnostic yield and calculation of likelihood ratios when the appendix is not visualized. This approach to reporting should be considered for all types of diagnostic ultrasound studies.","24512887","2014","4"
"27","Time to appendectomy and risk of perforation in acute appendicitis.","JAMA surgery","IMPORTANCE: In the traditional model of acute appendicitis, time is the major driver of disease progression; luminal obstruction leads inexorably to perforation without timely intervention. This perceived association has long guided clinical behavior related to the timing of appendectomy.<br />OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether there is an association between time and perforation after patients present to the hospital.<br />DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using data from the Washington State Surgical Care and Outcomes Assessment Program (SCOAP), we evaluated patterns of perforation among patients (â‰¥18 years) who underwent appendectomy from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2011. Patients were treated at 52 diverse hospitals including urban tertiary centers, a university hospital, small community and rural hospitals, and hospitals within multi-institutional organizations.<br />MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome of interest was perforation as diagnosed on final pathology reports. The main predictor of interest was elapsed time as measured between presentation to the hospital and operating room (OR) start time. The relationship between in-hospital time and perforation was adjusted for potential confounding using multivariate logistic regression. Additional predictors of interest included sex, age, number of comorbid conditions, race and/or ethnicity, insurance status, and hospital characteristics such as community type and appendectomy volume.<br />RESULTS: A total of 9048 adults underwent appendectomy (15.8% perforated). Mean time from presentation to OR was the same (8.6 hours) for patients with perforated and nonperforated appendicitis. In multivariate analysis, increasing time to OR was not a predictor of perforation, either as a continuous variable (odds ratioâ€‰=â€‰ 1.0 [95% CI, 0.99-1.01]) or when considered as a categorical variable (patients ordered by elapsed time and divided into deciles). Factors associated with perforation were male sex, increasing age, 3 or more comorbid conditions, and lack of insurance.<br />CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There was no association between perforation and in-hospital time prior to surgery among adults treated with appendectomy. These findings may reflect selection of those at higher risk of perforation for earlier intervention or the effect of antibiotics begun at diagnosis but they are also consistent with the hypothesis that perforation is most often a prehospital occurrence and/or not strictly a time-dependent phenomenon. These findings may also guide decisions regarding personnel and resource allocation when considering timing of nonelective appendectomy.","24990687","2014","8"
"28","First Report of Preoperative Imaging Diagnosis of a Surgically Confirmed Case of Valentino's Syndrome.","Journal of clinical imaging science","Perforation of a duodenal ulcer (DU) into the retroperitoneal space presenting with clinical features of acute appendicitis is known as Valentino's syndrome. Post duodenal perforation, the gastric and duodenal fluids tend to settle in the right paracolic gutter causing peritonitis and clinically mimicking acute appendicitis. Only three cases of Valentino's syndrome have been reported till date in the published literature and there is only one previous report of its preoperative imaging diagnosis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of preoperative imaging diagnosis in a surgically confirmed case of Valentino's syndrome. In most cases, patients with undiagnosed Valentino's syndrome are operated for acute appendicitis, and on finding a normal appendix, search is made for the cause of peritonitis, which then leads to retroperitoneal perforation of duodenum. The diagnosis of Valentino's syndrome by computed tomography (CT) imaging is easy and can help in avoiding the surgery or directing the surgeon directly to the repair of the duodenal perforation. It is, therefore, essential for emergency physicians, surgeons, and radiologists to know about this entity and consider it in the differential diagnosis.","24991479","2014",\N
"29","PCR for the diagnosis of abdominal angiostrongyliasis in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human tissue.","PloS one","To date the diagnosis of abdominal angiostrongyliasis (AA) depends on the histological identification of Angiostrongylus costaricensis (AC) in surgical specimens. However, microscopic evaluation is time consuming and often fails in identifying the parasite. We tested whether PCR might help in the diagnosis of AA by identifying parasite DNA in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. We used primers based on DNA from Angiostrongilus cantonensis. Four groups of FFPE intestinal tissue were tested: (1) confirmed cases (n = 20), in which AC structures were present in the target tissue; (2) presumptive cases (n = 20), containing changes secondary to AC infection in the absence of AC structures; (3) negative controls (n = 3), consisting of normal colonic tissue; and (4) tissue affected by other parasitoses (n = 7), including strongyloidiasis, ascaridiasis, schistosomiasis, and enterobiasis. Most lesions of confirmed cases were located in small and/or large bowel (90%), as compared with presumptive cases, in which 70% of lesions were in appendix (P = 0.0002). When confronted with cases of other parasitoses, PCR showed sensitivity of 55%, specificity of 100% and positive predictive value of 100%. In presumptive cases PCR was positive in 4 (20%). All specimens from negative controls and other parasitoses were negative. In conclusion, the PCR technique showed intermediate sensitivity and optimal specificity, being clinically relevant when positive for abdominal angiostrongyliasis. It allowed a 20% gain in diagnosis of presumptive cases. PCR might help in the diagnosis of abdominal angiostrongyliasis, particularly when the pathologists are not experienced with such disease.","24705328","2014",\N

Nonspecific abdominal pain was defined as abdominal pain for which the patient was seeking evaluation without a presumed diagnosis or referral for specific evaluation. Patients were evaluated by a physician who documented their differential diagnosis and planned diagnostic workup. Then, the physician performed EPUS, recorded their findings, and documented their post-EPUS differential diagnosis and planned diagnostic workup. This was compared with the patient's final diagnosis as determined by 2 emergency physicians blinded to the EPUS results.<br />RESULTS: A total of 128 patients were enrolled. Fifty-eight (45%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 36%-54%) had an improvement in diagnostic accuracy and planned diagnostic workup using EPUS. Sixty-four (50%; 95% CI, 41%-59%) would have been treated without further radiographic imaging. Fifty (39%; 95% CI, 31%-48%) would have been treated without any further laboratory testing or imaging.<br />DISCUSSION: Based on our findings, a future trial of 164 consecutive patients would have 90% power to confirm a 25% reduction in testing and a 25% improvement in decision making.<br />CONCLUSION: Emergency physician-performed ultrasound appears to positively impact decision making and diagnostic workup for patients presenting to the ED with NSAP and should be studied further.","24529645","2014","5"

American journal of roentgenology","OBJECTIVE: MRCP is increasingly used to evaluate pancreaticobiliary disease, yet its effect on patient care is unknown. The purpose of this study was to measure the effect of MRCP on referring physicians' initial diagnoses, the physicians' confidence in their diagnoses, and the influence of MRCP results on clinical management.<br />SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We prospectively surveyed gastroenterologists who referred patients for nonurgent MRCP for pancreaticobiliary evaluation. Before MRCP, gastroenterologists reported the working diagnosis, confidence level (high, moderate, low), and next step in clinical management if MRCP was unavailable. MRCP was performed with standard protocols, including secretin enhancement. After reviewing MRCP findings and without referring to their previous assessment, gastroenterologists reported a revised diagnosis, confidence level, and next step in clinical management. They then compared pre- and post-MRCP management plans and rated the influence of MRCP on changing management from 1 (none) to 5 (major). Diagnostic confidence and frequency of common diagnoses and recommendation for an invasive next-step procedure (e.g., ERCP) or endoscopic ultrasound were compared between pre- and post-MRCP assessments.<br />RESULTS: Survey data were analyzed on 171 patients (123 women, 48 men; mean age, 50 [SD, 17] years; range, 19-88 years) undergoing MRCP for unexplained abdominal pain (42.9%), suspected pancreaticobiliary neoplasm (20%), recent acute (17.1%) or suspected chronic (14.9%) pancreatitis, and other indications (5.1%). Recommendations of ERCP and endoscopic ultrasound decreased after MRCP (from 49.1% to 35.1%, p=0.03, and from 26.9% to 13.5%, pâ‰¤0.01). After MRCP, high confidence in diagnosis increased (from 72/171 to 100/171, p<0.01), as did recommendations for noninvasive therapy (from 18/171 to 56/171, p<0.01). A major or substantial change in clinical management was made in the care of 67 of 171 patients (39.2%).<br />CONCLUSION: Use of MRCP significantly changes gastroenterologists' treatment of patients with suspected pancreaticobiliary disease by increasing diagnostic confidence and reducing the frequency of invasive follow-up procedures.","23971448","2013","9"

"33","Institutional review of patients presenting with suspected appendicitis.","ANZ journal of surgery","BACKGROUND: Appendicitis is a common gastrointestinal surgical emergency. Treatment balances the risks of negative appendicectomy (NA) against potential complicated appendicitis in determining clinical priority. This study reviewed the population characteristics, results of the diagnostic modalities and Alvarado score (AlvS) of patients with suspected appendicitis.<br />METHODS: A clinical audit of emergency appendicectomies was performed. Generalized linear models with a binomial distribution were used to evaluate the association between the age groups, gender, white cell count (WCC), neutrophil count (NC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels versus NAs and the different types of appendicitis. The utilization and accuracy of preoperative ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) and a preliminary analysis of AlvS were also evaluated.<br />RESULTS: Patients 17 to 24 years old had significantly higher odds of NA but lower odds of complicated appendicitis compared with patients above 40 years. Adult women and men had significantly higher odds of NA and suppurative appendicitis (SA), respectively. Only adults with SA and acute appendicitis had significantly higher odds of raised WCC, NC and CRP. The sensitivity of CT for adult females was high (100%). Patients who had CT and an AlvS of more than 7 did not have NAs.<br />CONCLUSION: Elevated WCC, NC and CRP were all associated with acute appendicitis and SA in adults only. CT is useful for refining the diagnosis in adult females. A combination of inflammatory markers, ultrasound and AlvS may be used selectively to complement or maximize the advantages of CT.","24640953","2014","2"
"34","Pediatric appendectomy: optimal surgical timing and risk assessment.","The American surgeon","Appendicitis is one of the most common pediatric surgical problems. In the older surgical paradigm, appendectomy was considered to be an emergent procedure; however, with changes to resident work hours and other economic factors, the operation has evolved into an urgent and deliberately planned intervention. This paradigm shift in care has not necessarily seen universal buy-in by all stakeholders. Skeptics worry about the higher incidence of complications, particularly intra-abdominal abscess (IAA), associated with the delay to appendectomy with this strategy. Development of IAA after pediatric appendectomy greatly burdens the healthcare system, incapacitates patients, and limits family functionality. The risk factors that influence the development of IAA after appendectomy were evaluated in 220 children admitted to a large urban teaching hospital over a recent 1.5-year period. Preoperative risk factors included in the study were age, sex, weight, ethnicity, duration and nature of symptoms, white cell count, and ultrasound or computed tomography scan findings (appendicolith, peritoneal fluid, abscess, phlegmon), failed nonoperative management, antibiotics administered, and timing. Intraoperative factors included were timing of appendectomy, surgical and pathological findings of perforation, open or laparoscopic procedure, and use of staple or Endoloop to ligate the appendix. Postoperative factors included were duration and type of antibiotic therapy. There were 94 (43%) perforated and 126 (57%) nonperforated appendicitis during the study period. The incidence of postoperative IAA was 4.5 per cent (nine of 220). Children operated on after overnight antibiotics and resuscitation had a significantly lower risk of IAA as compared with children managed by other strategies (P < 0.0003). Of the preoperative factors, only the presence of a fever in the emergency department (P < 0.001) and identification of complicated appendicitis on imaging (P < 0.0001) were significant risk factors for postoperative abscess development. Perforated appendicitis carries a higher risk of development of IAA that is not reduced by an emergent operative or delayed nonoperative management strategy. The timing of appendectomy appears to be an extremely important factor in reducing the incidence of IAA after all presentations of appendectomy. The role of resuscitation and antibiotics in limiting the effects of the inflammatory cascade and development of laboratory markers that accurately measure the latter need to be the focus of further research in this field.","24887730","2014","5"

They were divided into 2 groups: lupus enteritis (n = 66) and non-lupus related abdominal pain (n = 73). The associated factors included demographic, laboratory, clinical and radiographic data.<br />RESULTS: Lupus enteritis (39.3%) was the most common cause of lupus patients with acute abdominal pain. There were no differences in autoantibody profiles, complement, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein and SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) score between two groups. The level of D-dimer and European consensus lupus activity measurement (ECLAM) score were significantly higher in the group of lupus enteritis than those in non-lupus related gastrointestinal injury. Lupus enteritis had significantly higher percentage of complications with multiple serous cavity effusions and ascites. But after adjusting with logistic regression multivariate analysis, only the level of D-dimer, ECLAM and volume of ascites were associated with occurrence of lupus enteritis.<br />CONCLUSION: Lupus enteritis is the most common cause of acute abdominal pain.

Although clinical outcomes of pediatric trauma patients with free fluid on diagnostic examinations without evidence of solid-organ injury have been studied, similar studies in the absence of trauma are rare. Our objective was to study clinical outcomes of children with acute abdominal pain of nontraumatic etiology and free intraperitoneal fluid on diagnostic imaging (abdominal/pelvic sonography, CT, or both).<br />METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of medical records of children aged 0 to 18 years presenting to a pediatric emergency department with acute abdominal pain (nontraumatic) between April 2008 and March 2009. Patients with intraperitoneal free fluid on imaging were divided into 2 groups: group I, imaging suggestive of an intra-abdominal surgical condition such as appendicitis; and group II, no evidence of an acute surgical condition on imaging, including patients with equivocal studies. Computed tomograms and sonograms were reviewed by a board-certified radiologist, and the free fluid volume was quantitated.<br />RESULTS: Of 1613 patients who underwent diagnostic imaging, 407 were eligible for the study; 134 (33%) had free fluid detected on diagnostic imaging. In patients with both sonography and CT, there was a significant correlation in the free fluid volume (r = 0.79; P < .0005). A significantly greater number of male patients with free fluid had a surgical condition identified on imaging (57.4% versus 25%; P < .001). Children with free fluid and an associated condition on imaging were more likely to have surgery (94.4% versus 6.3%; P < .001).<br />CONCLUSIONS: We found clinical outcomes (surgical versus nonsurgical) to be most correlated with a surgical diagnosis on diagnostic imaging and not with the amount of fluid present.","23980214","2013","9"

And they were categorized into nonperforated and early perforated appendicitis groups according to surgical and pathologic reports. The following CT findings were evaluated by two radiologists blinded to pathologic and surgical findings: transverse diameter of the appendix, thickness of the appendiceal wall, the depth of intraluminal appendiceal fluid, appendiceal wall enhancement, presence or absence of focal defect in the appendiceal wall, intraluminal appendiceal air, appendicolith/fecalith, periappendiceal changes, cecal wall thickening, and free fluid. The type of surgical procedures, performance of surgical drainage, and the length of hospital stay were recorded. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to determine the CT findings for differentiating early perforated appendicitis from nonperforated appendicitis, a total of 75 (22%) of the 339 patients was diagnosed with early perforated appendicitis. Focal wall defect [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 23.40; p < 0.001], circumferential periappendiceal changes (aOR, 5.63; p < 0.001), appendicoliths/fecaliths (aOR, 2.47; p = 0.015), and transverse diameter of the appendix (aOR, 1.22; p = 0.003) were independently differentiating variables for early perforated appendicitis. The transverse diameter of the appendix (â‰¥11 mm) had the highest sensitivity (62.7%) and focal wall defect in the appendiceal wall showed the highest specificity (98.8%). The prevalence of surgical drainage was higher (p = 0.001) and the mean hospital stay was approximately one day longer (p < 0.001) in the early perforated group than nonperforated group. CT can be helpful in differentiating early perforated appendicitis from nonperforated appendicitis, although the sensitivity of the evaluated findings was somewhat limited.","24633221","2014","6"

Blood samples from each patient were analyzed for CBC, differential, and 5 candidate proteins. Biomarker values were evaluated using principal component, recursive partitioning and logistic regression to select the combination that best discriminated between those subjects with and without disease.<br />RESULTS: The prevalence of acute appendicitis was 28.6%. A mathematical combination of three inflammation-related markers in a panel comprised of white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and myeloid-related protein 8/14 complex (MRP 8/14) provided the best discrimination. This panel exhibited a sensitivity of 96.5% (95% CI, 92-99%), a negative predictive value of 96.9% (95% CI, 93-99%), a negative likelihood ratio of 0.08 (95% CI, 0.03- 0.19), and a specificity of 43.2% (95% CI, 38-48%) for acute appendicitis.

Group 2 and 4 started refeeding early (once bowel sounds returned) and 1 and 3 started at standard time (bowel sounds present, no abdominal pain, no fever, leucocytes and pancreatic enzymes decreasing). Main outcomes measurements were LOHS and tolerance (ability to ingest >50% of meals without severe pain, nausea or AP relapse).<br />RESULTS: Eighty patients were evaluated and 72 randomized (median age 60 years, range 24-85, 33 male). LOHS was significantly reduced after early refeeding (median 5 versus 7 days (pÂ =Â 0.001)) but not in patients receiving immediately full caloric diet, compared to standard management (6 versus 6 days (pÂ =Â 0.12)). There was no difference in refeeding tolerance comparing immediately full caloric diet versus stepwise increasing diet (31/35 (89%) versus 33/37 (89%) patients tolerating the treatment, pÂ =Â 1.00) or early versus standard time for refeeding (33/37 (89%) versus 31/35 (89%), (pÂ =Â 1.00)).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Refeeding after AP when bowel sounds are present with immediately full caloric diet is safe and well tolerated. Early refeeding shortens LOHS.","24854611",\N,\N

Demographic information, clinical features, laboratory findings, SLE Disease Activity Index, and imaging characteristics were documented.<br />RESULTS: Of the 3823 SLE patients reviewed, 213 patients complained of abdominal pain and 132 cases were considered SLE-induced. The most common causes were lupus mesenteric vasculitis (LMV; 73.5%, 97/132) and lupus pancreatitis (LP; 17.4%, 23/132). Other causes included appendicitis, acute gastroenteritis, and peritonitis. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated the European Consensus Lupus Activity Measurement (ECLAM) score was significantly associated with lupus-induced abdominal pain (OR = 1.858, 95% CI: 1.441-2.394, p < 0.001), LMV (OR = 1.713, 95% CI: 1.308-2.244, p < 0.001), and LP (OR = 2.153, 95% CI: 1.282, 3.617, p = 0.004). The serum D-dimer level (OR = 1.004, 95% CI: 1.002-1.005, p < 0.001) was a strongly associated factor for lupus-induced abdominal pain. Moderate and large amounts of ascetic fluid was significantly associated with lupus-induced abdominal pain and LMV.

The aim of the present study was to determine clinical criteria for a careful and cost-effective integration of computed tomography (CT) scans in the clinical pathway for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.<br />METHODS: In this retrospective study, we analyzed all patients who were admitted to our hospital with suspected appendicitis (2008-2011). We included all patients who had an appendectomy with or without preoperative CT. Furthermore, we analyzed all patients who received a CT because of suspected appendicitis but did not have an appendectomy.<br />RESULTS: A total of 367 patients were included in this study. A CT was performed in 35 % of the patients with suspected appendicitis. Women had a significantly higher rate of negative appendectomy (NA) (16.5 %) than men (5.3 %). The frequency of NA was 5.7 % in the group of patients who were imaged, whereas it was 11.8 % (p = 0.075) among those who were not imaged. Thereby, CT scans helped to reduce total hospital expenses (<euro>1,317.44 (no CT scan) to <euro>675.85 (CT scan and no operation). Furthermore, CT scans can be avoided in men with normal white blood cell counts who should be observed if not operated immediately.<br />CONCLUSION: CT can be effectively applied for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. We propose a diagnostic algorithm which helps to simultaneously avoid unnecessary operations and radiation exposure.","24633534","2014","4"
"49","Imaging for appendicitis: should radiation-induced cancer risks affect modality selection?","Radiology","PURPOSE: To compare life expectancy (LE) losses attributable to three imaging strategies for appendicitis in adults-computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography (US) followed by CT for negative or indeterminate US results, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-by using a decision-analytic model.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this model, for each imaging strategy, LE losses for 20-, 40-, and 65-year-old men and women were computed as a function of five key variables: baseline cohort LE, test performance, surgical mortality, risk of death from delayed diagnosis (missed appendicitis), and LE loss attributable to radiation-induced cancer death. Appendicitis prevalence, test performance, mortality rates from surgery and missed appendicitis, and radiation doses from CT were elicited from the published literature and institutional data. LE loss attributable to radiation exposure was projected by using a separate organ-specific model that accounted for anatomic coverage during a typical abdominopelvic CT examination. One- and two-way sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate effects of model input variability on results.<br />RESULTS: Outcomes across imaging strategies differed minimally-for example, for 20-year-old men, corresponding LE losses were 5.8 days (MR imaging), 6.8 days (combined US and CT), and 8.2 days (CT). This order was sensitive to differences in test performance but was insensitive to variation in radiation-induced cancer deaths. For example, in the same cohort, MR imaging sensitivity had to be 91% at minimum (if specificity were 100%), and MR imaging specificity had to be 62% at minimum (if sensitivity were 100%) to incur the least LE loss. Conversely, LE loss attributable to radiation exposure would need to decrease by 74-fold for combined US and CT, instead of MR imaging, to incur the least LE loss.<br />CONCLUSION: The specific imaging strategy used to diagnose appendicitis minimally affects outcomes. Paradigm shifts to MR imaging owing to concerns over radiation should be considered only if MR imaging test performance is very high.","24988435","2014","11"

We sought to determine the outcome of initial antibiotics and interval AP in children with SAPA.<br />METHODS: Over an 18-month period, 751 consecutive patients underwent appendectomy including 105 patients with SAPA who were treated with initial intravenous antibiotics and planned interval AP â‰¥ 8 weeks after presentation. All SAPA patients had symptoms for â‰¤ 96 hours. Primary outcome variables were rates of readmission, abscess formation, and need for interval AP prior to the planned â‰¥ 8 weeks.<br />RESULTS: Intraabdominal abscess rate was 27%. Appendectomy prior to planned interval AP was 11% and readmission occurred in 34%. All patients underwent eventual appendectomy with pathologic confirmation confirming the previous appendiceal inflammation. White blood cell (WBC) count >15,000, WBC >15,000 plus fecalith on imaging, and WBC >15,000 plus duration of symptoms >48 hours were all significantly associated with higher rates of readmission (p=0.01, p=0.04, p=0.02) and need for interval AP prior to the planned â‰¥ 8 weeks (p=0.003, p=0.05, p=0.03).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of SAPA with antibiotics and planned interval AP is successful in the majority of patients; however, complications such as abscess formation and/or readmission prior to planned interval AP occur in up to one-third of patients.

This study aimed to determine whether clinical outcomes from weekend appendicectomy are different from those performed on weekdays.<br />METHOD: Multicentre cohort study during May-June 2012 from 95 centres (89 within the UK). The primary outcome was the 30-day adverse event rate. Multilevel modelling was used to account for clustering within hospitals while adjusting for case mix to produce adjusted ORs and 95% CIs.<br />RESULTS: When compared with Monday, there were no significant differences for other days of the week considering 30-day adverse events in adjusted models. On Sunday, rates of simple appendicitis were highest, and rates of normal (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.90) and complex appendicitis (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.93) lowest. This was accompanied by a 43% lower likelihood in use of laparoscopy on Sunday (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.69), accompanied by the lowest level of consultant presence for the week.

"61","Quantitative measurement of elasticity of the appendix using shear wave elastography in patients with suspected acute appendicitis.","PloS one","INTRODUCTION: Shear wave elastography (SWE) has not been studied for diagnosing appendicitis. We postulated that an inflamed appendix would become stiffer than a normal appendix. We evaluated the elastic modulus values (EMV) by SWE in healthy volunteers, patients without appendicitis, and patients with appendicitis. We also evaluated diagnostic ability of SWE for differentiating an inflamed from a normal appendix in patients with suspected appendicitis.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one patients with clinically suspected acute appendicitis and 11 healthy volunteers were prospectively enrolled. Gray-scale ultrasonography (US), SWE and multi-slice computed tomography (CT) were performed. The EMV was measured in the anterior, medial, and posterior appendiceal wall using SWE, and the highest value (kPa) was recorded.<br />RESULTS: Patients were classified into appendicitis (nâ€Š=â€Š30) and no appendicitis groups (nâ€Š=â€Š11). One case of a negative appendectomy was detected. The median EMV was significantly higher in the appendicitis group (25.0 kPa) compared to that in the no appendicitis group (10.4 kPa) or in the healthy controls (8.3 kPa) (p<0.001). Among SWE and other US and CT features, CT was superior to any conventional gray-scale US feature or SWE. Either the CT diameter criterion or combined three CT features predicted true positive in 30 and true negative in 11 cases and yielded 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. An EMV of 12.5 kPa for the stiffest region of the appendix predicted true positive in 28, true negative in 11, and false negative in two cases. The EMV (â‰¥12.5 kPa) yielded 93% sensitivity and 100% specificity.<br />CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that EMV by SWE helps distinguish an inflamed from a normal appendix. Given that SWE has high specificity, quantitative measurement of the elasticity of the appendix may provide complementary information, in addition to morphologic features on gray-scale US, in the diagnosis of appendicitis.","25051242","2014",\N
"62","Utility of CT after sonography for suspected appendicitis in children: integration of a clinical scoring system with a staged imaging protocol.","Emergency radiology","To improve diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis, many institutions have implemented a staged imaging protocol utilizing ultrasonography (US) first and then computed tomography (CT). A substantial number of children with suspected appendicitis undergo CT after US, and the efficient and accurate diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis continues to be challenging. The objective of the study is to characterize the utility of CT following US for diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis, in conjunction with a clinical appendicitis score (AS). Imaging studies of children with suspected appendicitis who underwent CT after US in an imaging protocol were retrospectively reviewed by three radiologists in consensus. Chart review derived the AS (range 0-10) and obtained the patient diagnosis and disposition, and an AS was applied to each patient. Clinical and radiologic data were analyzed to assess the yield of CT after US. Studies of 211 children (mean age 11.3Â years) were included. The positive threshold for AS was determined to be 6 out of 10. When AS and US were concordant (Nâ€‰=â€‰140), the sensitivity and specificity of US were similar to CT. When AS and US were discordant (Nâ€‰=â€‰71) and also when ASâ€‰â‰¥â€‰6 (Nâ€‰=â€‰84), subsequent CT showed superior sensitivity and specificity to US alone. In the subset where US showed neither the appendix nor inflammatory change in the right lower quadrant (126/211, 60Â % of scans), when ASâ€‰<â€‰6 (Nâ€‰=â€‰83), the negative predictive value (NPV) of US was 0.98. However, when ASâ€‰â‰¥â€‰6 (Nâ€‰=â€‰43), NPV of US was 0.58, and the positive predictive value of subsequent CT was 1. There was a significant decrease in depiction of the appendix on US with patient weight-to-age ratio of >6 (kg/year, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and after-hours (1700 -0730Â hours) performance of US (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Results suggest that the appendicitis score has utility in guiding an imaging protocol and support the contention that non-visualization of the appendix on US is not intrinsically non-diagnostic. There was little benefit to additional CT when ASâ€‰<â€‰6 and US did not show the appendix or evidence of inflammation; this would have avoided CT in 140/211 (66Â %) patients. CT demonstrated benefit when ASâ€‰â‰¥â€‰6, suggesting that cases with ASâ€‰â‰¥â€‰6 and features that limit depiction of the appendix on US may be triaged to CT.","24917390","2014","6"

However, on-call time, an unchanged need for broad surgical skills are required to meet the demands of acute surgical disease and trauma. The introduction of a new subspecialty in North America that deals solely with acute care surgery and trauma is an attempt to offer properly trained surgeons also during on-call time. To find out whether such a subspecialty could be helpful in Sweden we analyzed our workload for emergency surgery and trauma.<br />METHODS: LinkÃ¶ping University Hospital serves a population of 257 000. Data from 2010 for all patients, diagnoses, times and types of operations, surgeons involved, duration of stay, types of injury and deaths regarding emergency procedures were extracted from a prospectively-collected database and analyzed.<br />RESULTS: There were 2362 admissions, 1559 emergency interventions; 835 were mainly abdominal operations, and 724 diagnostic or therapeutic endoscopies. Of the 1559 emergency interventions, 641 (41.1%) were made outside office hours, and of 453 minor or intermediate procedures (including appendicectomy, cholecystectomy, or proctological procedures) 276 (60.9%) were done during the evenings or at night. Two hundred and fifty-four patients were admitted with trauma and 29 (11.4%) required operation, of whom general surgeons operated on eight (3.1%). Thirteen consultants and 11 senior registrars were involved in 138 bowel resections and 164 cholecystectomies chosen as index operations for standard emergency surgery. The median (range) number of such operations done by each consultant was 6 (3-17) and 6 (1-22). Corresponding figures for senior registrars were 7 (0-11) and 8 (1-39).<br />CONCLUSION: There was an uneven distribution of exposure to acute surgical problems and trauma among general surgeons. Some were exposed to only a few standard emergency interventions and most surgeons did not operate on a single patient with trauma. Further centralization of trauma care, long-term positions at units for emergency surgery and trauma, and subspecialisation in the fields of emergency surgery and trauma, might be options to solve problems of low volumes.","22985447","2012",\N

Obstetrics and gynecological conditions (OB-GYNc) are difficult to be differentiated from appendicitis in young adult females presenting with acute lower abdominal pain. Timely and correct diagnosis is clinically challenging. Method. A retrospective data analysis was performed on 542 female patients who were admitted to a tertiary care hospital with a chief complaint of acute lower abdominal pain. Diagnostic indicators of appendicitis and OB-GYNc were identified by stepwise multivariable polytomous logistic regression. Diagnostic performances of the scores were tested. Result. The developed clinical score is comprised of (1) guarding or rebound tenderness, (2) pregnancy, (3) sites of abdominal tenderness, (4) leukocytosis, (5) peripheral neutrophils â‰¥75%, and (6) presence of diarrhea. For diagnosis of appendicitis, the area under the ROC curve was 0.8696, and the sensitivity and specificity were 89.25% and 70.00%. For OB-GYNc, the corresponding values were 0.8450, 66.67%, and 94.85%, respectively. Conclusion. The clinical scoring system can differentiate the diagnosis of acute lower abdominal pain in young adult females.

Choice of operation was based on individual surgeon's preference and on patient's body size. Data collected included rate of histologically complicated appendicitis, post-operative length of stay (LOS), and collective and differential morbidity rates, i.e., wound infection, intra-abdominal collection, and ileus. Chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests were used for statistical analysis. P<0.05 was regarded as significant.<br />RESULTS: Eighty children (70% male) were identified at median age 11 (3-15) years. They could be divided into complicated (n=18, 22%) and simple appendicitis (n=62, 78%). Appendicectomy was performed in all as an OPEN (n=53, 66%) or LAPAROSCOPIC (n=27, 34%) procedure. Both groups were comparable in gender distribution (P=0.11) and rate of complicated appendicitis (30% vs. 19%, respectively; P=0.27).

We sought to determine diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography, and laparoscopy and compared benefits and advantages in patients with suspected AA.<br />PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients who had laparoscopic surgery between January 2000 and December 2009 was conducted. Preoperative information, surgery results, and outcomes were compared.<br />RESULTS: Of 887 laparoscopic procedures performed for suspected AA, 254 (29%) patients had preoperative imaging: 171 CT scans and 83 ultrasound (US) scans. Overall, 754 patients underwent laparoscopic appendectomy (LA), and 133 underwent diagnostic laparoscopy (DL). DL was negative in 23 patients. The sensitivity of LA was higher than that of CT (98% versus 94%), whereas the specificity of LA was higher than that of CT and US in complicated appendicitis and in women. Complicated AA was significantly less common in patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery compared with patients evaluated by preoperative CT. Comparing the kappa value between the preoperative diagnosis by imaging and DL, a weak agreement was found (Îº=0.234 Â± 0.057).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopy achieves early and accurate diagnosis of AA and can reduce the incidence of perforated appendicitis. Abdominal CT remains a valuable diagnostic tool. DL is useful in the early stages of the diagnostic work-up and avoids unnecessary exposure to radiation of the abdomen and pelvis in young women.","24134071","2013","12"
"69","Effect of pain control in suspected acute appendicitis on the diagnostic accuracy of surgical residents.","CJEM","UNLABELLED: ABSTRACTObjective:To determine the influence of early pain relief for patients with suspected appendicitis on the diagnostic performance of surgical residents.<br />METHODS: A prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted for patients with suspected appendicitis. The patients were randomized to receive placebo (normal saline intravenous [IV]) infusions over 5 minutes or the study drug (morphine 5 mg IV). All of the clinical evaluations by surgical residents were performed 30 minutes after administration of the study drug or placebo. After obtaining the clinical probability of appendicitis, as determined by the surgical residents, abdominal computed tomography was performed. The primary objective was to compare the influence of IV morphine on the ability of surgical residents to diagnose appendicitis.<br />RESULTS: A total of 213 patients with suspected appendicitis were enrolled. Of these patients, 107 patients received morphine, and 106 patients received placebo saline. The negative appendectomy percentages in each group were similar (3.8% in the placebo group and 3.2% in the pain control group, p â€Š=â€Š 0.62). The perforation rates in each group were also similar (18.9% in the placebo group and 14.3% in the pain control group, p â€Š=â€Š 0.75). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that the overall diagnostic accuracy in each group was similar (the area under the curve of the placebo group and the pain control group was 0.63 v. 0.61, respectively, p â€Š=â€Š 0.81).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Early pain control in patients with suspected appendicitis does not affect the diagnostic performance of surgical residents.","24456838","2014","2"
"70","Admission Levels of Serum Amyloid A and Procalcitonin are More Predictive of the Diagnosis of Acute Appendicitis Compared With C-reactive Protein.","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques","BACKGROUND: Acute appendicitis is the commonest surgical emergency, but its diagnosis can be elusive with a negative appendicectomy rate of 20%. The aims of this study were to investigate the potential value of the markers of acute inflammation, serum amyloid A (SAA), and serum procalcitonin (ProCT), in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in adults and to compare that with the commonly used serum C-reactive protein (CRP).<br />METHODS: Adult patients presenting with acute right lower abdominal pain and a clinical suspicion of acute appendicitis were included. Blood samples were obtained within 6 hours of admission for rapid serum CRP assay and for end-of-recruitment batch analysis of SAA and serum ProCT concentrations.<br />RESULTS: A total of 147 patients (81 males) with a mean (Â±SD) age of 36 (Â±17) years were recruited. Appendicitis was confirmed histologically in 61 of 72 patients (84.7%) who underwent appendicectomy. A post hoc analysis revealed a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for SAA of 92% and 72%, ProCT of 85% and 74%, and CRP of 75% and 72%, respectively. The receiver operator characteristics for the area under the curves showed that SAA (P=0.011) and ProCT (P=0.037) significantly exceeded CRP in the prediction of acute appendicitis on admission.<br />CONCLUSIONS: The measurement of SAA and serum ProCT on admission in patients with clinically suspected acute appendicitis seems to outperform serum CRP in aiding that diagnosis.","24910938","2014","12"
"71","Prevalence and clinicopathological characteristics of appendiceal carcinoids in Sharjah (United Arab Emirates).","World journal of gastrointestinal oncology","AIM: To determine the incidence and clinico-pathological profile of appendiceal carcinoids in a cohort of patients undergoing emergency appendicectomies for clinically suspected acute appendicitis in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates (UAE).<br />METHODS: The study included the retrospective data of 964 patients operated for clinically suspected acute appendicitis, and the resected specimens were received at Al-Qasmi Hospital (Sharjah) from January 2010 to December 2010. The data of the patients who were histologically reported to have carcinoid tumors of the appendix were extensively evaluated for the patient's demographics, indication for surgery, surgical procedure, tumor localization in the appendix, diameter of the lesion, concomitant appendicitis, immunohistochemistry studies and clinical follow-up.<br />RESULTS: Out of the 964 patients included in the study, 9 (0.93%) were found to have appendiceal carcinoids. The mean age reported was 28.7 years with a male to female ratio of 2:1. Eight tumors were located near the tip of the appendix with a mean diameter of 3.3 mm, while the remaining one was near the proximal end of the appendix. All the cases were associated with concomitant suppurative appendicitis. In seven reported cases, tumors were confined to the muscular layer while in one case each there was an extension to the serosa and mesoappendix, respectively. All tumors were found to be positive for chromogranin A, synaptophysin and neuron-specific enolase on immunohistochemistry but negative for cytokeratin-7. None of the patients developed recurrence or any reportable complications in the short follow-up period (12-26 mo) that was arranged as a six-monthly re-evaluation by abdominal ultrasonography.<br />CONCLUSION: Our study found a higher incidence of appendiceal carcinoids in patients undergoing emergency appendectomy for acute appendicitis in Sharjah, UAE compared to two previous studies from the Persian Gulf region. Interestingly, tumors were found to be more commonly in young males, which is in contrast to previous studies. Moreover, all the tumors were positive for common neuroendocrine markers.","25024816","2014","7"

Service provision and outcome of appendicectomy in children may differ between such units.<br />METHODS: This multicentre observational study included all children (aged less than 16 years) who had an appendicectomy at either a paediatric surgery unit or general surgery unit. The primary outcome was normal appendicectomy rate (NAR). Secondary outcomes included 30-day adverse events, use of ultrasound imaging and laparoscopy, and consultant involvement in procedures.<br />RESULTS: Appendicectomies performed in 19 paediatric surgery units (242 children) and 54 general surgery units (461 children) were included. Children treated in paediatric surgery units were younger and more likely to have a preoperative ultrasound examination, a laparoscopic procedure, a consultant present at the procedure, and histologically advanced appendicitis than children treated in general surgery units. The unadjusted NAR was significantly lower in paediatric surgery units (odds ratio (OR) 0.37, 95 per cent confidence interval 0.23 to 0.59; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), and the difference persisted after adjusting for age, sex and use of preoperative ultrasound imaging (OR 0.34, 0.21 to 0.57; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Female sex and preoperative ultrasonography, but not age, were significantly associated with normal appendicectomy in general surgery units but not in paediatric surgery units in this adjusted model. The unadjusted 30-day adverse event rate was higher in paediatric surgery units than in general surgery units (OR 1.90, 1.18 to 3.06; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.011). When adjusted for case mix and consultant presence at surgery, no statistically significant relationship between centre type and 30-day adverse event rate existed (OR 1.59, 0.93 to 2.73; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.091).<br />CONCLUSION: The NAR in general surgery units was over twice that in paediatric surgery units. Despite a more severe case mix, paediatric surgery units had a similar 30-day adverse event rate to general surgery units. Service provision differs between paediatric and general surgery units.","24700440","2014","5"
"74","A prospective longitudinal evaluation and affecting factors of health related quality of life after appendectomy.","International journal of surgery (London, England)","BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to longitudinally evaluate the pattern of Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) alterations, as an indirect convalescence index after appendectomy, to assess the timing of its restoration to the healthy population levels and to attempt a profound investigation into factors determining HRQoL outcomes.<br />METHODS: Uncomplicated cases of histologically verified acute appendicitis (AA) were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. HRQoL indices were collected at baseline, 15 days, 1 and 3 months using EQ-5D, SF-36 and, GIQLI questionnaires. Data were processed with non-parametric tests and logistic regression analysis.<br />RESULTS: For the 147 patients eventually included, significant improvements compared to baseline at EQ-5D and SF-36 general health and physical function domains were noted at 15 days, while bodily pain was worse. The majority HRQoL parameters were significantly better at the 1st and the 3rd-month compared to baseline and the 15th-day assessments. General health, physical and emotional function were restored at the general population levels between 15 days and 1 month, while bodily pain, social function and EQ-5D indices between the 1st and 3rd month. Logistic regression analysis indicated that high Alvarado score was the most powerful predictor of HRQoL impairment with older age coming second.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Post-appendectomy HRQoL disturbances predominate and the burden of AA should not be underestimated. Convalescence period as translated by HRQoL restoration may be extended beyond the second week and up to the first month. Degree of inflammation and patient's age emerged as key mediators of HRQoL outcomes.","25019228","2014",\N

"77","Gastrointestinal tract duplications in children.","European review for medical and pharmacological sciences","AIM: Gastrointestinal tract duplications (GTD) are rare congenital abnormalities that can occur anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract. These anomalies may present as a single, multiple, or a vague pathologies. Diagnosing and treating these diseases may be difficult in some patients. We aimed to present 32 patients who were followed and treated in our clinic.<br />PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included the patients between 2000 and 2013. Evaluations included clinical presentations, diagnostic strategies and algorithms, surgical procedures and associated anomalies, and presence of ectopic tissue, complications, and prognosis.<br />RESULTS: Common clinical presentations included vomiting (n=8; 25%), palpable abdominal mass (n=4; 13%). Twenty-eight patients (2 of them antenatally) were diagnosed preoperatively while four of them were diagnosed at surgery. Ileal duplications constituted the most common type (34%) while the least common ones were located in appendix, thoracoabdomen and rectum. One of our patients was present with a gastric duplication which was closely interconnected to a tubular duplication of esophagus, which had never been encountered in the literature before.<br />CONCLUSIONS: It is crucial to note that duplications are likely to occur in various types and numbers and also may accompany other anomalies. Computed Tomography (CT) remains the method of choice since Magnetic Resonance (MR) is likely to cause the use of sedation and analgesia at very young ages and it may also be relatively costly despite being more sensitive in soft tissues. Mucosal stripping is an ideal method for the patients requiring restricted surgery. The antenatal asymptomatic cases can be operated after their 6th months of age.","24899610","2014",\N

The numbers of operations, types of operations, lengths of stay (LOS), operation start times, rates of negative histology specimens and readmissions within 30 days were compared. One hundred and twenty-five appendicectomies [48 laparoscopic (38.4 %)] were performed in the 2007 group of which 32 specimens (25.6 %) were histologically negative. Three hundred and nineteen appendicectomies [238 laparoscopic (74.6 %)] were performed in the 2011 group of which 62 specimens (19.4 %) were histologically negative. The increase in numbers of laparoscopic procedures was significant (p < 0.001). The reduction in the negative appendicectomy rate was not statistically significant (p = 0.16). There were 10 conversions (20.8 %) to open surgery in the 2007 period and 12 (5 %) in the 2011 period (p = 0.001). Mean LOS for the 2007 and 2011 groups was 4.45 and 3.16 days (p < 0.001). Six (4.8 %) readmissions within 30 days occurred in the 2007 group with 20 (6.3 %) in the 2011 group (p = 0.66).<br />CONCLUSION: Though reconfiguration of surgical services has resulted in a significant increase in workload, LOS has decreased significantly while maintaining acceptably low negative appendicectomy, conversion and readmission rates.","24091613","2014","9"
"79","Is pelvic ultrasound associated with an increased time to appendectomy in pediatric appendicitis?","The Journal of emergency medicine","BACKGROUND: Appendicitis is a common pediatric condition requiring urgent surgical intervention to prevent complications. Pelvic ultrasound (US) as a diagnostic aid has become increasingly common. Despite its advantages, evidence suggests US can lead to delayed definitive management.<br />OBJECTIVE: The objective was to test the hypothesis that US is associated with an increased time to appendectomy in children with acute appendicitis.<br />METHODS: A chart review was conducted of all children aged 0-17 years who presented to the pediatric emergency department (ED) with a discharge diagnosis of appendicitis. The primary outcome variable was the interval between initial evaluation to appendectomy between patients who received an US and those who did not.<br />RESULTS: Of 662 cases included, 424 patients (64%) underwent a pelvic US and 238 patients underwent an appendectomy without US. Median time interval from initial evaluation in the ED by a physician to appendectomy among patients who received an US was 9.7 h (interquartile range [IQR]: 6.8-15.0 h) compared with 5.5 h (IQR: 3.8-8.6 h) among patients who did not receive an US (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.001). The increased time to appendectomy in patients who received an US was dependent on the patient being female and presenting to the ED after hours (univariate analysis of variance test for interaction, p < 0.05).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Female pediatric patients and those presenting after hours that undergo an US have a significantly increased time to appendectomy compared with those who do not undergo diagnostic imaging.","24680102","2014","7"

"81","Accuracy of MRI compared with ultrasound imaging and selective use of CT to discriminate simple from perforated appendicitis.","The British journal of surgery","BACKGROUND: Discrimination between simple and perforated appendicitis in patients with suspected appendicitis may help to determine the therapy, timing of surgery and risk of complications. The aim of this study was to estimate the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in distinguishing between simple and perforated appendicitis, and to compare MRI against ultrasound imaging with selected additional (conditional) use of computed tomography (CT).<br />METHODS: Patients with clinically suspected appendicitis were identified prospectively at the emergency department of six hospitals. Consenting patients underwent MRI, but were managed based on findings at ultrasonography and conditional CT. Radiologists who evaluated the MRI were blinded to the results of ultrasound imaging and CT. The presence of perforated appendicitis was recorded after each evaluation. The final diagnosis was assigned by an expert panel based on perioperative data, histopathology and clinical follow-up after 3â€‰months.<br />RESULTS: MRI was performed in 223 of 230 included patients. Acute appendicitis was the final diagnosis in 118 of 230 patients, of whom 87 had simple and 31 perforated appendicitis. MRI correctly identified 17 of 30 patients with perforated appendicitis (sensitivity 57 (95 per cent confidence interval 39 to 73) per cent), whereas ultrasound imaging with conditional CT identified 15 of 31 (sensitivity 48 (32 to 65) per cent) (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.517). All missed diagnoses of perforated appendicitis were identified as simple acute appendicitis with both imaging protocols. None of the MRI features for perforated appendicitis had a positive predictive value higher than 53 per cent.<br />CONCLUSION: MRI is comparable to ultrasonography with conditional use of CT in identifying perforated appendicitis. However, both strategies incorrectly classify up to half of all patients with perforated appendicitis as having simple appendicitis. Triage of appendicitis based on imaging for conservative treatment is inaccurate and may be considered unsafe for decision-making.

"82","Use of white blood cell count and negative appendectomy rate.","Pediatrics","BACKGROUND: Despite increased utilization of laboratory, radiologic imaging, and scoring systems, negative appendectomy (NA) rates in children remain above 3% nationwide. We reviewed the clinical data of patients undergoing appendectomy to further reduce our NA rate.<br />METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of all appendectomies performed for suspected appendicitis at a tertiary children's hospital during a 42-month period. Preoperative clinical, laboratory, and radiographic data were collected. Variables absent or normal in more than half of NAs were further analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed for continuous variables by using appropriate cutoff points to determine sensitivity and false-positive rates. The results were validated by analyzing the 12 months immediately after the establishment of these rules.<br />RESULTS: Of 847 appendectomies performed, 22 (2.6%) had a pathologically normal appendix. The only variables found to be normal in more than half of NAs were white blood cell (WBC) count (89%) and neutrophil count (79%). A receiver operating characteristic curve indicates that using WBC cutoffs of 9000 and 8000 per ÂµL yielded sensitivities of 92% and 95%, respectively, and reduction in NA rates by 77% and 36%, respectively. Results observed in the subsequent 12 months confirmed these expected sensitivities and specificities.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Absence of an elevated WBC count is a risk factor for NA. Withholding appendectomy for WBC counts <9000 and 8000 per ÂµL reduces the NA rate to 0.6% and 1.2%, respectively. Missed true appendicitis in patients with normal WBC counts can be mitigated by a trial of observation in those presenting with early symptom onset.","24379236","2014","1"

All hemodynamically stable patients who presented with abdominal free fluid without solid organ injury on CT scan were analyzed for radiological interpretation, clinical management, operative findings, and outcome.<br />RESULTS: A total of 122 patients were included in the study, 91 % of whom were males. The mean age of the patients was 33 Â± 12 years. A total of 34 patients underwent exploratory laparotomy, 31 of whom had therapeutic interventions. Small bowel injuries were found in 12 patients, large bowel injuries in ten, and mesenteric injuries in seven patients. One patient had combined small and large bowel injury, and one had traumatic gangrenous appendix. In the remaining three patients, laparotomy was non-therapeutic. A total of 36 patients had associated pelvic fractures and 33 had multiple lumbar transverse process fractures.<br />CONCLUSION: Detection of intra-peritoneal fluid by CT scan is inaccurate for prediction of bowel injury or need for surgery. However, the correlation between CT scan findings and clinical course is important for optimal diagnosis of bowel and mesenteric injuries.","24368575","2014","6"

Thirty-one patients underwent MR imaging. A trend toward fewer operations (odds ratio [OR], 0.45; 95% CI, 0.18-1.16; Pâ€‰=â€‰.07) was observed in the MR imaging group. Seven nontherapeutic explorations were performed in the non-MR imaging group and 1 nontherapeutic exploration in the MR imaging group (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.08-2.32; Pâ€‰=â€‰.13). Patients in the MR imaging group were more frequently discharged from the emergency department (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.13-0.94; Pâ€‰=â€‰.04) and had shorter LOS (33.7 vs 64.8 hours, Pâ€‰<â€‰.001).

On multivariable analysis, the receipt of MR imaging (Pâ€‰<â€‰.001) and the absence of operative intervention (Pâ€‰=â€‰.001) were associated with shorter LOS. The mean hospital charges were similar in those with vs without appendicitis. One fetal loss occurred in the non-MR imaging group.<br />CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Magnetic resonance imaging in pregnant patients with suspected appendicitis does not affect clinical outcomes or hospital charges. It allows safe discharge from the emergency department and improves resource use.","24871698","2014","7"
"86","Computed tomography with intravenous contrast alone: the role of intra-abdominal fat on the ability to visualize the normal appendix in children.","Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine","BACKGROUND: Computed tomography (CT) with enteric contrast is frequently used to evaluate children with suspected appendicitis. The use of CT with intravenous (IV) contrast alone (CT IV) may be sufficient, however, particularly in patients with adequate intra-abdominal fat (IAF).<br />OBJECTIVES: The authors aimed 1) to determine the ability of radiologists to visualize the normal (nondiseased) appendix with CT IV in children and to assess whether IAF adequacy affects this ability and 2) to assess the association between IAF adequacy and patient characteristics.<br />METHODS: This was a retrospective 16-center study using a preexisting database of abdominal CT scans. Children 3 to 18 years who had CT IV scan and measured weights and for whom appendectomy history was known from medical record review were included. The sample was chosen based on age to yield a sample with and without adequate IAF. Radiologists at each center reread their site's CT IV scans to assess appendix visualization and IAF adequacy. IAF was categorized as \"adequate\" if there was any amount of fat completely surrounding the cecum and \"inadequate\" if otherwise.<br />RESULTS: A total of 280 patients were included, with mean age of 10.6 years (range = 3.1 to 17.9 years). All 280 had no history of prior appendectomy; therefore, each patient had a presumed normal appendix. A total of 102 patients (36.4%) had adequate IAF. The proportion of normal appendices visualized with CT IV was 72.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 67.2% to 78.0%); the proportions were 89% (95% CI = 81.5% to 94.5%) and 63% (95% CI = 56.0% to 70.6%) in those with and without adequate IAF (95% CI for difference of proportions = 16% to 36%). Greater weight and older age were strongly associated with IAF adequacy (p < 0.001), with weight appearing to be a stronger predictor, particularly in females. Although statistically associated, there was noted overlap in the weights and ages of those with and without adequate IAF.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Protocols using CT with IV contrast alone to visualize the appendix can reasonably include weight, age, or both as considerations for determining when this approach is appropriate. However, although IAF will more frequently be adequate in older, heavier patients, highly accurate prediction of IAF adequacy appears challenging solely based on age and weight.","24033622","2013","8"
"87","Laparoscopy for the management of acute lower abdominal pain in women of childbearing age.","The Cochrane database of systematic reviews","BACKGROUND: This is an updated version of the original review, published in Issue 1, 2011, of The Cochrane Library. Acute lower abdominal pain is common, and making a diagnosis is particularly challenging in premenopausal women, as ovulation and menstruation symptoms overlap with symptoms of appendicitis, early pregnancy complications and pelvic infection. A management strategy involving early laparoscopy could potentially provide a more accurate diagnosis, earlier treatment and reduced risk of complications.<br />OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and harms of laparoscopy for the management of acute lower abdominal pain in women of childbearing age.<br />SEARCH METHODS: TheÂ Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, LILACS and CINAHL were searched (October 2013). The International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) was also searched. No new studies were included in this updated version.<br />SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that included women of childbearing age who presented with acute lower abdominal pain, non-specific lower abdominal pain or suspected appendicitis were included. Trials were included if they evaluated laparoscopy with open appendicectomy, or laparoscopy with a wait and see strategy. Study selection was carried out by two review authors independently.<br />DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data from studies that met the inclusion criteria were independently extracted by two review authors and the risk of bias assessed. We used standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. A summary of findings table was prepared using GRADE criteria.<br />MAIN RESULTS: A total of 12 studies including 1020 participants were incorporated into the review. These studies had low to moderate risk of bias, mainly because allocation concealment or methods of sequence generation were not adequately reported. In addition, it was not clear whether follow-up was similar for the treatment groups. The index test was incorporated as a reference standard in the laparoscopy group, and differential verification or partial verification bias may have occurred in most RCTs. Overall the quality of the evidence was low to moderate for most outcomes, as per the GRADE approach.Laparoscopy was compared with open appendicectomy in eight RCTs. Laparoscopy was associated with an increased rate of specific diagnoses (seven RCTs, 561 participants; odds ratio (OR) 4.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.50 to 6.71; I(2) = 18%), but no evidence was found of reduced rates for any adverse events (eight RCTs, 623 participants; OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.10; I(2) = 0%). A meta-analysis of seven studies found a significant difference favouring the laparoscopic procedure in the rate of removal of normal appendix (seven RCTs, 475 participants; OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.24; I(2) = 0%).Laparoscopic diagnosis versus a 'wait and see' strategy was investigated in four RCTs. A significant difference favoured laparoscopy in terms of rate of specific diagnoses (four RCTs, 395 participants; OR 6.07, 95% CI 1.85 to 29.88; I(2) = 79%), but no evidence suggested a difference in rates of adverse events (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.67; I(2) = 0%). Â <br />AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found that laparoscopy in women with acute lower abdominal pain, non-specific lower abdominal pain or suspected appendicitis led to a higher rate of specific diagnoses being made and a lower rate of removal of normal appendices compared with open appendicectomy only. Hospital stays were shorter. No evidence showed an increase in adverse events when any of these strategies were used.","24848893","2014",\N

We conducted a retrospective, case-control study in which each case ages 4 to 20 years with symptomatic cholelithiasis was individually matched to a control admitted with appendicitis based on age, sex, ethnicity, and race.<br />RESULTS: The prevalence of obesity and the cholelithiasis hospitalization rate increased over time (R=0.87, P=0.0025). For every 1% increase in the obesity rate among children, the rate of hospitalization for gallstones increased by 0.65/100,000 children (RÂ²=0.75, P=0.0025, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32-0.99). The odds ratio for obesity in cases versus controls was 5.78 (n=518, P<0.0001, 95% CI 3.50-9.53). We found a significant dose-response effect, which showed that for every 1 z score increase in body mass index, the risk of cholelithiasis was increased by 79% (P<0.0001, 95% CI 1.5-2.13).<br />CONCLUSIONS: The national trend in the prevalence of obesity from 1997 to 2009 was significantly correlated with increasing rates of hospitalization for pediatric cholelithiasis. Our case-control study suggests that obesity is a significant risk factor for hospital admission because of cholelithiasis.","23969538","2014","1"
"90","Further exploration during open appendicectomy; assessment of some common intraoperative findings.","Pakistan journal of medical sciences","OBJECTIVE: Very few studies are available to relate the final histology of excised appendix with the detailed intra-operative findings during appendectomy, both open and laparoscopic. This study was aimed to correlate the histological features of appendix specimen with the intra operative findings at open appendicectomy (OA) in a bid to determine when to change the planned procedure to include further exploration. Methods : A prospective study that observes the condition of the greater omentum (GO), the vermiform appendix and peritoneal exudates at all OA done for uncomplicated appendicitis. Histological examination of the appendices done using the H&E stain. Results : Eighty-five patients had emergency open OA, their(') ages range from 6 to 62 yrs (median = 23yrs). Histology showed 7 normal appendix (HNA), 56 acute (HAA) and 22 \"non acute\" appendicitis (HNAA). Negative appendicectomy rate was 8.2%. The GO was sighted more in patients with HAA than HNAA (p=0.00015) and also significantly more inflamed in the former (p=0.00028). It is not significantly inflamed in those with HNAA (p=0.945). The negative predictive value (NPV) of absent GO is 35.7% while the positive predictive value (PPV) of sighted normal GO and inflamed GO are 92.8% and 100% respectively. The PPV and NPV of presence of pus for diseased appendix are 95.8% and 9.8% respectively while those of excess fluid are 94.8% and 10.8%. The PPV and NPV of macroscopic assessment of the appendix for inflammation are 97% and 45.5% respectively giving the diagnostic accuracy of 90.6%. A significant trend of increasing probability of histologically inflamed appendix with increasing severity of macroscopic feature was seen (X(2) = 004 df=1, p<0.005).<br />CONCLUSION: High positive and low negative predictive values are similar for all the three parameters assessed. The macroscopic appearance of the appendix has a predictive likelihood ratio for further exploration.","24772134","2014","3"

Primary outcomes were days of hospital stay, surgical procedure duration, and overall post-operative complication rate. Secondary outcomes were wound infection and intra-abdominal abscesses formation rate, hospital charges.<br />RESULTS: Laparoscopic appendectomy showed to be significantly associated with lower wound infection (P < 0.001) and post-operative complication rate (P < 0.001). Surgical time was considered as a hallmark of technical challenge and resulted diminished in the laparoscopic group (P = 0.018). Although not clinically relevant per se, the statistically significant shorter hospital stay (P < 0.001) was probably the reason of decreased hospital charges (P < 0.001). Intra-abdominal abscesses formation rate was higher in the open appendectomy group (P = 0.058), although slightly above the statistical significance threshold.<br />CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic approach seemed to show relevant advantages compared to open appendectomy, but a large prospective trial is necessary to collect high quality data and investigate long-term outcomes.","24501501","2014","1"
"94","Amyand's hernias in childhood (a report on 21 patients): a single-centre experience.","Pediatric surgery international","PURPOSE: Amyand's hernia is a very rare type of hernia and is characterised by the presence of a vermiform appendix in the inguinal hernia sac. It may present as a tender inguinal or inguinoscrotal swelling, and is usually misdiagnosed as an irreducible or strangulated inguinal hernia. This is a presentation of our experiences with these unusual hernias.<br />METHODS: This study conducted a retrospective analysis of 21 patients with Amyand's hernias operated on at our institution between April 2007 and February 2011. The age and sex distributions of the patients, the types of hernias, and preoperative diagnostic tests were evaluated.<br />RESULTS: Twenty patients were male (95.3Â %) and one was female (4.7Â %). The median age was 20.3Â months (ranging from 2Â months to 10Â years). In nine patients, the conditions were diagnosed using ultrasonographic (USG) imaging preoperatively. Nine of the 21 patients underwent emergency operations. The 12 remaining patients were operated on after preparations were completed. The operative findings included 12 normal appendixes, five inflamed appendixes, one perforated appendix, and three hernias whose inner hernia sac surface was adhered to the appendix. Nine patients underwent inguinal hernia repair with appendectomy, and 12 patients had hernia repair without an appendectomy. Recurring hernias and appendicitis were not detected in any patients within the follow-up time.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Although a routine appendectomy is not required for a normal-looking appendix, in a case where the inflammatory status of the appendix adheres to the surface of the hernia sac, an appendectomy is required. We believe that USG examination in the diagnosis of Amyand's hernias can provide additional contribution.","23417545","2013","6"
"95","Normal patterns of 18F-FDG appendiceal uptake in children.","Pediatric radiology","BACKGROUND: Prior to interpreting PET/CT, it is crucial to understand the normal biodistribution of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). It is also important to realize that the normal biodistribution can vary between adults and children. Although many studies have defined normal patterns of pediatric FDG uptake in structures like the thymus, brown fat and bone marrow, patterns of normal pediatric bowel activity, specifically uptake within the appendix, have not been well described. Active lymphoid tissue has increased FDG uptake when compared with inactive tissue. Since children have more active lymphoid tissue than adults, and because the appendix contains aggregated lymphoid tissue, we postulated that appendiceal uptake may be increased in pediatric patients.<br />OBJECTIVE: To define the normal level of appendiceal FDG activity in children by evaluating a series of consecutive FDG PET/CT scans performed for other indications.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: After obtaining IRB approval, we retrospectively reviewed 128 consecutive whole-body pediatric FDG PET/CT examinations obtained for a variety of clinical indications. CT scans on which the appendix could not be visualized were excluded from analysis. CT scans on which the appendix could be visualized were evaluated for underlying appendiceal pathology. Studies with appendiceal or periappendiceal pathology by CT criteria were excluded. A region of interest (ROI) was placed over a portion of each appendix and appendiceal maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was calculated. If an adjacent loop of bowel activity interfered with accurate measurements of the appendix SUVmax, the scan was excluded from the analysis. A chart review was performed on patients with elevated appendiceal SUVmax values to ensure that the patients did not have clinical symptomatology suggestive of acute appendicitis. When the appendix or a portion of the appendix could be visualized and accurately measured, the SUVmax was determined. SUVmax of the appendix was compared to the SUVmax of normal liver and ratios were recorded.<br />RESULTS: A total of 128 scans were reviewed, patient ages 1 month to 21 years (mean age: 11.6 years). Thirty-one scans were excluded because of inability to visualize the appendix on CT. No scans were excluded for appendiceal/periappendiceal pathology on CT or chart review. No scans had to be excluded for inability to obtain an accurate SUVmax measurement because measurements were calculated on portions of the appendix separate from adjacent bowel using small ROIs. Maximum appendiceal SUVs ranged from 0.5 to 9.4 (mean: 2.2) with an appendix-to-liver background ratio ranging from 0.3 to 3.1 (mean: 1.1).<br />CONCLUSION: FDG uptake in the appendix is typically similar to that of background activity. However, slight variations in appendiceal FDG uptake do occur, which should not be misinterpreted as pathological.","24287869","2014","4"

A retrospective study was undertaken at an ED of a tertiary hospital in Tasmania using clinical notes on patient presenting with acute abdominal pain who underwent an AXR. The study also included a short questionnaire, which assessed emergency physicians' knowledge of current imaging guidelines and clinical practice when ordering an AXR. During the study period, 108 patients satisfied the selection criteria, and the AXR was reported as normal in 76Â % (nâ€‰=â€‰82; p value <0.05), non-specific in 12Â % (nâ€‰=â€‰13; p value <0.05) and abnormal in 12Â % (nâ€‰=â€‰13; p value <0.05) of patients. Of those patients, 25Â % (nâ€‰=â€‰27) of the AXRs did not meet indications listed in the Diagnostic Imaging Pathways published by the Western Australia Department of Health and were found not to benefit patient care. Of the 19 doctors who completed the survey, only 16Â % (nâ€‰=â€‰3) were aware of any clinical guidelines for imaging in this setting. Current guidelines should be followed when ordering imaging for patients with acute abdominal pain to minimise unnecessary patient radiation exposure, avoid delays in diagnosis and definitive patient management, reduce costs and therefore increase efficiency in ED.","24880255","2014","12"
"97","Ultrasonography/MRI versus CT for diagnosing appendicitis.","Pediatrics","BACKGROUND: Cross-sectional imaging increases accuracy in diagnosing appendicitis. We hypothesized that a radiation-free imaging pathway of ultrasonography selectively followed by MRI would not change clinical end points compared with computed tomography (CT) for diagnosis of acute appendicitis in children.<br />METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed children (<18 years old) who had diagnostic imaging for suspected acute appendicitis between November 2008 and October 2012. Before November 2010 CT was used as the primary imaging modality (group A); subsequently, ultrasonography was the primary imaging modality followed by MRI for equivocal findings (group B). Data collected included time from triage to imaging and treatment and results of imaging and pathology.<br />RESULTS: Six hundred sixty-two patients had imaging for suspected appendicitis (group A = 265; group B = 397, of which 136 [51%] and 161 [41%], respectively, had positive imaging for appendicitis). Negative appendectomy rate was 2.5% for group A and 1.4% for group B. Perforation rate was similar for both groups. Time from triage to antibiotic administration and operation did not differ between groups A and B. There was higher proportion of positive imaging and appendectomies in group A and thus more negative imaging tests in group B (ultrasonography and MRI), but diagnostic accuracy of the 2 imaging pathways was similar.<br />CONCLUSIONS: In children with suspected acute appendicitis, a radiation-free diagnostic imaging of ultrasonography selectively followed by MRI is feasible and comparable to CT, with no difference in time to antibiotic administration, time to appendectomy, negative appendectomy rate, perforation rate, or length of stay.","24590746","2014","4"

However, the intraoperative evaluation of the appendix is difficult, as the negative appendectomy rate remains 12%-18%. The aim of this study is to analyze the intraoperative motive for performing a laparoscopic appendectomy of an appendix that was proven to be noninflamed after histological examination.<br />METHODS: In 2008 and 2009, in five hospitals, operation reports of all negative laparoscopic appendectomies were retrospectively analyzed in order to assess the intraoperative motive for removing the appendix.<br />RESULTS: A total of 1,465 appendectomies were analyzed with an overall negative appendectomy rate of 9% (132/1,465). In 57% (841/1,465), a laparoscopic appendectomy was performed, with 9% (n = 75) negative appendectomies. In 51% of the negative appendectomies, the visual assessment of the appendix was decisive in performing the appendectomy. In 33%, the surgeon was in doubt whether the appendix was inflamed or normal. In 4%, the surgeon was aware he removed a healthy appendix, and in 9%, an appendectomy was performed for different reasons.<br />CONCLUSION: In more than half of the microscopic healthy appendices, the surgeon was convinced of the diagnosis appendicitis during surgery.

In particular, gastrointestinal imaging has been identified as a significant factor that contributes to exposure of children to radiation during diagnostic procedures. We performed a longitudinal assessment of gastrointestinal-associated DIPs to identify practices that might be targeted to reduce exposure of pediatric patients toÂ radiation.<br />METHODS: DIP insurance claims from 2001 through 2009 were obtained from an Independent Physicians Association in a large US metropolitan area. We retrieved and analyzed Current Procedural Terminology codes, associated International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, codes specific for gastrointestinal symptoms and conditions, and patient demographics associated with DIPs from insurance claims data.<br />RESULTS: Overall, 11,473 DIPs were performed on 6550 children with gastrointestinal symptoms; 1 in 30 patients received a DIP for a gastrointestinal complaint. Over the study period, the proportion of higher-radiation DIPs (computed tomography, fluoroscopy, and angiography) increased. Higher-radiation DIPs for gastrointestinal symptoms were performed more frequently in older children and in boys in the emergency department and in inpatient settings for diagnoses of abdominal pain, appendicitis, and noninfectious gastroenteritis.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Higher-radiation diagnostic imaging accounts for an increasing proportion of imaging procedures among children with gastrointestinal symptoms, even though these often are not recommended for evaluation of gastrointestinal disorders. Clinicians should be aware of these findings when ordering DIPs for gastrointestinal complaints, and clinical practice guidelines should be created to reduce diagnostic imaging-related radiation exposure in children.","24035771","2014","6"

Negative appendectomy rates were compared among imaging modalities, age groups and genders. We retrospectively reviewed US and CT findings from negative appendectomy cases.<br />RESULTS: The overall negative appendectomy rate was 7.0% (26/374). There were no statistically significant differences among the subgroups. The most common misleading presentations on US were sonographic tenderness (9/16, 56%) and non-compressibility (9/16, 56%). The most common misleading finding on CT were the presence of an appendicolith or hyperdense feces (5/12, 42%).

The possibility of negative appendicitis should be borne in mind when periappendiceal fat inflammation is absent or minimal in indeterminate cases.","24840768","2014","10"
"108","Risk of perforation increases with delay in recognition and surgery for acute appendicitis.","The Journal of surgical research","BACKGROUND: Appendicitis remains a common indication for urgent surgical intervention in the United States, and early appendectomy has long been advocated to mitigate the risk of appendiceal perforation. To better quantify the risk of perforation associated with delayed operative timing, this study examines the impact of length of inpatient stay preceding surgery on rates of perforated appendicitis in both adults and children.<br />METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional analysis using the National Inpatient Sample and Kids' Inpatient Database from 1988-2008. We selected patients with a discharge diagnosis of acute appendicitis (perforated or nonperforated) and receiving appendectomy within 7 d after admission. Patients electively admitted or receiving drainage procedures before appendectomy were excluded. We analyzed perforation rates as a function of both age and length of inpatient hospitalization before appendectomy.<br />RESULTS: Of 683,590 patients with a discharge diagnosis of appendicitis, 30.3% were recorded as perforated. Over 80% of patients underwent appendectomy on the day of admission, approximately 18% of operations were performed on hospital days 2-4, and later operations accounted for <1% of cases. During appendectomy on the day of admission, the perforation rate was 28.8%; this increased to 33.3% for surgeries on hospital day 2 and 78.8% by hospital day 8 (P<0.001). Adjusted for patient, procedure, and hospital characteristics, odds of perforation increased from 1.20 for adults and 1.08 for children on hospital day 2 to 4.76 for adults and 15.42 for children by hospital day 8 (P<0.001).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Greater inpatient delay before appendectomy is associated with increased perforation rates for children and adults within this population-based study. These findings align with previous studies and with the conventional progressive pathophysiologic appendicitis model. Randomized prospective studies are needed to determine which patients benefit from nonoperative versus surgically aggressive management strategies for acute appendicitis.","23290595","2013","10"
"109","Community acquired secondary bacterial peritonitis in a tertiary hospital of South India: an audit with special reference to peritoneal fluid culture.","Tropical gastroenterology : official journal of the Digestive Diseases Foundation","BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to elucidate the spectrum of community acquired acute bacterial peritonitis, the role of microbiological culture in its management and other factors affecting its outcome.<br />METHODS: This was a prospective study wherein we examined cases of secondary bacterial peritonitis admitted and operated at our institution from January 2005 to May 2006. The peritoneal fluid was sent for bacterial culture and sensitivity testing. Patients were followed up with relevant progress details till discharge or death.<br />RESULTS: We enrolled 352 patients. The mean age of the study population was 42.4 years with a male:female ratio of 7:1. Gastroduodenal perforations formed the major site of perforation (51%), followed by small bowel (29%) and appendicular perforations (17%). Culture positivity rate was 64%. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species were the predominant isolates from peritoneal fluid. These main isolates were predominantly sensitive to ceftazidime, amikacin and chloramphenicol. Ampicillin with gentamicin and metronidazole was the first line of treatment used preoperatively in 67% of the patients, given its low cost and easier availability. The overall morbidity and mortality rates were 52% and 16.5% respectively. 78% of patients received inadequate antibiotics preoperatively. Only 26% had appropriate change of antibiotics postoperatively.<br />CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant benefit of postoperative change of antibiotics based on culture results. Analysis of factors influencing mortality shows dominance of host related factors over the type and source of infection with high risk population identified by age > 60 years, delayed presentations > 3 days and APACHE II score > 15.","23923354",\N,\N
"110","Is single port incisionless-intracorporeal conventional equipment-endoscopic surgery feasible in patients with retrocecal acute appendicitis?","Journal of the Korean Surgical Society","PURPOSE: Since laparoscopic appendectomy was first described, various modifications, such as single port incisionless-intracorporeal conventional equipment-endoscopic surgery (SPICES), have been described for reducing pain and improving cosmetic results. In the retrocecal and retrocolic positions, attachments to the lateral peritoneum and cecum may lead to difficulties during SPICES, which is performed with only one port. Here, we present the effects of variations in the position of the vermiform appendix in treating acute appendicitis with SPICES.<br />METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 52 children who underwent SPICES for acute appendicitis between March 2010 and November 2011 in our institution. One group (group A) consisted of 30 patients (mean age, 10.5 Â± 2.5 years) with retrocecal appendix, while the other group (group B) included 22 patients (mean age, 10.9 Â± 2.3 years) with the appendix lying free in the peritoneal cavity.<br />RESULTS: There were no significant differences between groups in terms of patient age, gender, success rate of SPICES, mean operating time, mean follow-up period, overall complication rates or mean postoperative hospitalization period.<br />CONCLUSION: These results suggest that SPICES is a safe and feasible approach even in patients with retrocecal acute appendicitis.","23908965","2013","8"

This study aimed to investigate variation in provision and outcome of emergency appendicectomy.<br />METHODS: A multicentre, trainee-led, protocol-driven, prospective observational cohort study was performed during May and June 2012. The main outcome of interest was the normal histopathology rate; secondary outcomes were laparoscopy and 30-day adverse event rates. Analysis included funnel plots and binary logistic regression models to identify patient- and hospital-related predictors of outcome.<br />RESULTS: A total of 3326 patients from 95 centres were included. An initial laparoscopic approach was performed in 66.3 per cent of patients (range in centres performing more than 25 appendicectomies over the study period: 8.7-100 per cent). A histologically normal appendix was removed in 20.6 per cent of patients (range in centres performing more than 25 procedures: 3.3-36.8 per cent). Funnel plot analysis revealed that 22 centres fell below three standard deviations of the mean for laparoscopy rates. Higher centre volume, consultant presence in theatre and daytime surgery were independently associated with an increased use of laparoscopy, which in turn was associated with a reduction in 30-day morbidity (adjusted for disease severity). Daytime surgery further reduced normal appendicectomy rates. Increasing volume came at the cost of higher negative rates, and low negative rates came at the cost of higher perforation rates.<br />CONCLUSION: This study reveals the extremely wide variation in practice patterns and outcomes among hospitals. Organizational factors leading to this variation have been identified and should be addressed to improve performance.","23842836","2013","8"

"113","Predictors of appendiceal perforation in an equal access system.","The Journal of surgical research","BACKGROUND: Discrepancies in socioeconomic factors have been associated with higher rates of perforated appendicitis. As an equal-access health care system theoretically removes these barriers, we aimed to determine if remaining differences in demographics, education, and pay result in disparate outcomes in the rate of perforated appendicitis.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients undergoing appendectomy for acute appendicitis (November 2004-October 2009) at a tertiary care equal access institution were categorized by demographics and perioperative data. Rank of the sponsor was used as a surrogate for economic status. A multivariate logistic regression model was performed to determine patient and clinical characteristics associated with perforated appendicitis.<br />RESULTS: A total of 680 patients (mean age 30Â±16 y; 37% female) were included. The majority were Caucasian (56.4% [n=384]; African Americans 5.6% [n=38]; Asians 1.9% [n=13]; and other 48.9% [n=245]) and enlisted (87.2%). Overall, 6.4% presented with perforation, with rates of 6.6%, 5.8%, and 6.7% (P=0.96) for officers, enlisted soldiers, and contractors, respectively. There was no difference in perforation when stratified by junior or senior status for either officers or enlisted (9.3% junior versus 4.40% senior officers, P=0.273; 6.60% junior versus 5.50% senior enlisted, P=0.369). On multivariate analysis, parameters such as leukocytosis and temperature, as well as race and rank were not associated with perforation (P=0.7). Only age had a correlation, with individuals aged 66-75 y having higher perforation rates (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.05; P<0.001).<br />CONCLUSIONS: In an equal-access health care system, older age, not socioeconomic factors, correlated with increased appendiceal perforation rates.","24656477","2014","7"
"114","Guidelines of diagnostics and treatment of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis.","Digestive surgery","BACKGROUND: The incidence of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis (ACD) is increasing in the Western world. To improve the quality of patient care, a guideline for diagnosis and treatment of diverticulitis is needed.<br />METHODS: A multidisciplinary working group, representing experts of relevant specialties, was involved in the guideline development. A systematic literature search was conducted to collect scientific evidence on epidemiology, classification, diagnostics and treatment of diverticulitis. Literature was assessed using the classification system according to an evidence-based guideline development method, and levels of evidence of the conclusions were assigned to each topic. Final recommendations were given, taking into account the level of evidence of the conclusions and other relevant considerations such as patient preferences, costs and availability of facilities.<br />RESULTS: The natural history of diverticulitis is usually mild and treatment is mostly conservative. Although younger patients have a higher risk of recurrent disease, a higher risk of complications compared to older patients was not found. In general, the clinical diagnosis of ACD is not accurate enough and therefore imaging is indicated. The triad of pain in the lower left abdomen on physical examination, the absence of vomiting and a C-reactive protein >50 mg/l has a high predictive value to diagnose ACD. If this triad is present and there are no signs of complicated disease, patients may be withheld from further imaging. If imaging is indicated, conditional computed tomography, only after a negative or inconclusive ultrasound, gives the best results. There is no indication for routine endoscopic examination after an episode of diverticulitis. There is no evidence for the routine administration of antibiotics in patients with clinically mild uncomplicated diverticulitis. Treatment of pericolic or pelvic abscesses can initially be treated with antibiotic therapy or combined with percutaneous drainage. If this treatment fails, surgical drainage is required. Patients with a perforated ACD resulting in peritonitis should undergo an emergency operation. There is an ongoing debate about the optimal surgical strategy.<br />CONCLUSION: Scientific evidence is scarce for some aspects of ACD treatment (e.g. natural history of ACD, ACD in special patient groups, prevention of ACD, treatment of uncomplicated ACD and medical treatment of recurrent ACD), leading to treatment being guided by the surgeon's personal preference. Other aspects of the management of patients with ACD have been more thoroughly researched (e.g. imaging techniques, treatment of complicated ACD and elective surgery of ACD). This guideline of the diagnostics and treatment of ACD can be used as a reference for clinicians who treat patients with ACD.","23969324","2013",\N
"115","The role of US examination in the management of acute abdomen.","Critical ultrasound journal","Acute abdomen is a medical emergency, in which there is sudden and severe pain in abdomen of recent onset with accompanying signs and symptoms that focus on an abdominal involvement. It can represent a wide spectrum of conditions, ranging from a benign and self-limiting disease to a surgical emergency. Nevertheless, only one quarter of patients who have previously been classified with an acute abdomen actually receive surgical treatment, so the clinical dilemma is if the patients need surgical treatment or not and, furthermore, in which cases the surgical option needs to be urgently adopted. Due to this reason a thorough and logical approach to the diagnosis of abdominal pain is necessary. Some Authors assert that the location of pain is a useful starting point and will guide a further evaluation. However some causes are more frequent in the paediatric population (like appendicitis or adenomesenteritis) or are strictly related to the gender (i.e. gynaechologic causes). It is also important to consider special populations such as the elderly or oncologic patients, who may present with atypical symptoms of a disease. These considerations also reflect a different diagnostic approach. Today, surely the integrated imaging, and in particular the use of multidetector Computed Tomography (MDCT) has revolutionised the clinical approach to this condition, simplyfing the diagnosis but burdening the radiologists with the problems related to the clinical management. However although CT emerging as a modality of choice for evaluation of the acute abdomen, ultrasonography (US) remains the primary imaging technique in the majority of cases, especially in young and female patients, when the limitation of the radiation exposure should be mandatory, limiting the use of CT in cases of nondiagnostic US and in all cases where there is a discrepancy between the clinical symptoms and negative imaging at US.","23902801","2013","7"

Fifty-eight RPF treatment cases in the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University were retrospectively analyzed, including clinical characteristics and laboratory data. RPF was found predominantly in elderly men with atypical clinical manifestations of back pain, abdominal pain, and lower limb edemas. In laboratory examinations, the acute-phase reactants such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels increased significantly. Renal function failure was frequently found in patients with urethral obstruction. All patients had retroperitoneal soft tissue shadows or urethral obstructions on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), seven of which had histological diagnosis of idiopathic RPF. Forty-two patients received surgical interventions; 29 patients received medication treatment alone including corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and tamoxifen; 17 patients received corticosteroids after surgical intervention. Surgery followed by medication was most effective for RPF. CT and MRI help to exclude secondary causes, but biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis. Long-term low-dose corticosteroids and immunosuppressants may prevent relapse of RPF.","24756854","2014","12"

The study population included 17 false-negative cases (11% of all macroscopically normal appendices). Tumors were found in 1.1% of our study population. Female gender (1.9% vs. .5%; odds ratio, 4; 95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 11; P < .005) and appendiceal perforation were independent risk factors for harboring a tumor.<br />CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that laparoscopy has diagnostic quality similar to that of the open approach. Until randomized trials evaluate the fate of patients who receive false-negative diagnoses, routine appendectomy is recommended. Special attention should be paid to female patients and to patients with perforations, who have a 4-fold increased risk for harboring a tumor.","24016703","2013","11"

A multivariate analysis was performed to create a predictive score of discharge within the first 24 hours. The score was prospectively used on every AA from January 1, 13 to December 15, 2013. All patients with 5 or 4 points were proposed for AmbSurg.<br />RESULTS:: A total of 468 patients were included retrospectively, 181(38.7%) were discharged within the first 24 hours. In multivariate analysis, predictive factors of early discharge were body mass index less than 28 kg/m, white cell count less than 15,000/mL, C-reactive protein less than 30 mg/L, no radiological signs of perforation, and appendix diameter of 10 mm or smaller. Rate of discharge at day 1 was 72%, 45%, 39%, 21%, 0%, and 0% according to the score 5 to 0 (P < 0.0001). Prospectively, 184 patients had AA and 103 (56%) had a score of 4 or 5. Thirty-eight underwent ambulatory LA [16 (42%) patients were postponed to the next day and went back home]. All patients were directly discharged from recovery room, except 1 (2.6%) patient, after a mean hospital stay of 8.4 hours Â± 6.9 hours. A total of 146 patients underwent LA in conventional surgery and 58% were discharged at day 1.

"120","A new adult appendicitis score improves diagnostic accuracy of acute appendicitis--a prospective study.","BMC gastroenterology","BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to construct a new scoring system for more accurate diagnostics of acute appendicitis. Applying the new score into clinical practice could reduce the need of potentially harmful diagnostic imaging.<br />METHODS: This prospective study enrolled 829 adults presenting with clinical suspicion of appendicitis, including 392 (47%) patients with appendicitis. The collected data included clinical findings and symptoms together with laboratory tests (white cell count, neutrophil count and C-reactive protein), and the timing of the onset of symptoms. The score was constructed by logistic regression analysis using multiple imputations for missing values. Performance of the constructed score in patients with complete data (nâ€‰=â€‰725) was compared with Alvarado score and Appendicitis inflammatory response score.<br />RESULTS: 343 (47%) of patients with complete data had appendicitis. 199 (58%) patients with appendicitis had score value at least 16 and were classified as high probability group with 93% specificity.Patients with score below 11 were classified as low probability of appendicitis. Only 4% of patients with appendicitis had a score below 11, and none of them had complicated appendicitis. In contrast, 207 (54%) of non-appendicitis patients had score below 11. There were no cases with complicated appendicitis in the low probability group. The area under ROC curve was significantly larger with the new score 0.882 (95% CI 0.858-0.906) compared with AUC of Alvarado score 0.790 (0.758-0.823) and Appendicitis inflammatory response score 0.810 (0.779-0.840).<br />CONCLUSIONS: The new diagnostic score is fast and accurate in categorizing patients with suspected appendicitis, and roughly halves the need of diagnostic imaging.","24970111","2014",\N

In patients with undiagnosed HAE, abdominal symptoms often create the risk of unnecessary surgical operation and/or drug therapy. To explore the cause of misdiagnosis, we compared the laboratory findings of HAE patients under normal conditions with those during abdominal attacks.<br />METHODS: Patient medical histories were analyzed and laboratory data at the first consultation with no symptoms and no medication were compared with those at visits to the emergency department during severe attacks.<br />RESULTS: Fourteen HAE patients were enrolled. Initial HAE symptoms occurred at 20.2 Â± 9.4 years of age. The correct diagnosis of HAE was made 22.7 Â± 14.2 years after the initial symptoms. A common site of angioedema was the extremities. Half of the patients experienced a life-threatening laryngeal attack and/or severe abdominal pain. In the patients with severe abdominal pain, significant leukocytosis with neutrophilia along with increased levels of hematocrit were observed while levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) remained low. All severe attacks were alleviated with an infusion of C1-inhibitor concentrate.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Consideration of the likelihood of a HAE attack is important when patients present with acute abdominal pain and leukocytosis without elevation of CRP.","23915279","2013",\N

Patients may present with acute obstruction or chronic abdominal pain. These symptoms are caused by Ladd's bands and narrow mesentery resulting from incomplete gut rotation. Barium, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), angiography and sometimes explorative laparotomy are used for diagnosis. Ladd's procedure is the treatment of choice but data about laparoscopic approach in adult is scarce. We report three cases of laparoscopic correction of adult malrotation presenting with chronic abdominal pain. The diagnosis is made by CT/MRI. Laparoscopic Ladd's procedure (release of bands, broadening of mesentery and appendicectomy) was performed via three ports. Procedure time 25-45 min. All patients were discharged on postoperative day 2. At 6 month follow-up, all are symptom free. Laparoscopic Ladd's procedure is an acceptable alternative to the open technique in treating chronic symptoms of intestinal malrotation in adults.","24761085","2014","4"

We investigated for each patient the pathway following ultrasound examination and definitive diagnosis. The impact of ultrasonography was defined based on the frequency with which the information resulting from this examination confirmed or denied the diagnostic suspicion made by the emergency physician on the basis of clinical and laboratory findings.<br />RESULTS: In 497/729 patients (69Â %), ultrasound examination did not determine variations in the diagnostic and therapeutic pathways, either because it confirmed the outcome of clinical examination and laboratory tests, or because, even addressing in the opposite direction to these, the emergency physician did not consider its result because of being particularly alarmed or sufficiently reassured by clinical examination and laboratory tests. In the remaining 232/729 cases (31Â %), ultrasound examination determined an increase or a reduction of the provided care and attention (subsequently proved justified in the vast majority of cases) in spite of what was initially assessed based on clinical examination and laboratory tests.<br />CONCLUSIONS: The results of our retrospective study demonstrated that ultrasonography was a valuable tool in the management of pediatric patients with acute abdominal pain together with clinical examination and laboratory tests.","24432175","2013","10"

Overall sensitivity for diagnosis by clinical assessment (71.4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 63.3-79.5) was not significantly different to that using adjunct ultrasonography (77.7%, 95% CI 69.7-85.7; P = 0.29). Adjunct ultrasonography was more sensitive between 7 and 11 years (81% versus 68%, P = 0.002) and possibly in girls (86% versus 73%, P = 0.1), but did not increase the sensitivity of the diagnosis in children who presented with milder symptoms and signs.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Adjunct ultrasonography may not increase the overall accuracy of diagnosis of acute appendicitis in children but holds promise in certain subgroups viz. between 7 and 11 years and in girls. There is an increase in negative appendicectomies following a 'non-targeted' use of ultrasonography. Future prospective trials should take cognizance of these findings in designing the subgroup analysis.","24754725","2014","5"
"133","Non-operative management of early, acute appendicitis in children: is it safe and effective?","Journal of pediatric surgery","PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine if early, acute appendicitis in children can be safely and effectively managed with antibiotics alone.<br />METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of children (<18 yrs) treated non-operatively (NOM) for early, acute appendicitis since May 2012. These were compared to patients treated with appendectomy between January 2011 and October 2011 (OM). Inclusion criteria included: (a) symptoms <48 h, (b) localized peritonitis, and (c) ultrasound findings consistent with early, acute appendicitis.<br />RESULTS: Twelve patients (66% female, mean age 12.2,SD=4.2 yrs) were treated non-operatively, while 12 (50% female, mean age 12.5,SD=3.2 yrs) were treated operatively. Two NOM children (16.7%) required initial appendectomy. One patient developed recurrent appendicitis requiring appendectomy 7 months post-discharge. Four other NOM patients returned with symptoms but did not require admission or surgery. Two OM patients (8.3%) had hospital visits and admissions related to surgical site infections. Mean length of stay (LOS) for the first visit was 1.5 days (SD=1.0d) (NOM) vs. 1.3 days (SD=0.5d) (OM) (p=0.61). Including first and subsequent admissions, mean LOS was 1.8 days (SD=1.1d) (NOM) vs. 1.7 days (SD=1.5d) (OM) (p=0.97).<br />CONCLUSION: Early acute appendicitis in appropriately selected children can be successfully treated non-operatively. Randomized trials with longer follow-up are required.","24851770","2014","5"
"134","A simple clinical decision rule to rule out appendicitis in patients with nondiagnostic ultrasound results.","Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine","OBJECTIVES: The objective was to identify a set of clinical features that can rule out appendicitis in patients with suspected acute appendicitis and nondiagnostic ultrasound (US) results, allowing safe discharge and next-day reevaluation without initial computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).<br />METHODS: Data on clinical and US evaluation, including a number of prespecified variables potentially associated with acute appendicitis, were prospectively collected in two diagnostic accuracy studies of imaging. These studies included patients with suspected appendicitis seen in the emergency department (ED). For development and validation of the clinical decision rule (CDR), only patients with inconclusive or negative US results were included. There were 199 (of 422) patients in the development cohorts and 120 (of 211) patients in the validation cohort. Logistic regression analysis was used for data from patients with inconclusive or negative US results, and profiles were created of all possible combinations of predictors retained in the multivariable model. A final diagnosis was assigned by an expert panel based on perioperative data, histopathology, and clinical follow-up of at least 3 months.<br />RESULTS: The CDR selected patients after negative or inconclusive US for discharge and next-day reevaluation without initial CT or MRI if fewer than two of the following predictors were present: male sex, migration of pain to the right lower quadrant, vomiting, and white blood cell (WBC) count higher than 12.0 Ã— 10(9) /L. Applying the CDR in the development set selected 126 of 199 (63%) patients with negative or inconclusive US results for discharge without further imaging. This rule reduced the probability of appendicitis from 26% (51 of 199) in the total group of patients with negative or inconclusive US results to 12% (15 of 126) in the group that would be discharged based on the rule (p = 0.001). In the validation set (n = 120), the decision rule selected 72 (60%) patients for discharge and next-day reevaluation and reduced the probability of appendicitis from 20% (24 of 120) in the total group to 6% (4 of 72) in the patients selected on the rule (p = 0.001). The negative predictive value of the decision rule in the validation set was 94% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 87% to 98%). In comparison, the negative predictive value of CT in the same group was 99% (95% CI = 93% to 100%, p = 0.14), and that of MRI was 99% (95% CI = 94% to 100%, p = 0.12). Alternative decision rules based on combinations of the present decision rule with C-reactive protein (CRP) results did not improve selection.<br />CONCLUSIONS: This newly developed CDR significantly reduces the probability of appendicitis in a large subgroup of patients with negative or inconclusive US results. These patients can be safely discharged for outpatient reevaluation without further initial imaging if proper follow-up is available. This could assist in lowering the number of ED imaging investigations in patients with suspected appendicitis.","24842498","2014","5"

Patients were divided into two groups. appendicitis group (Group A) consisted of patients who underwent appendectomy and were histopathologically diagnosed with acute appendicitis, and non-appendicitis group (Group N-A) consisted of patients who underwent negative appendectomy and were diagnosed with pathologies other than appendicitis and patients that were followed non-operatively. The operative findings for the patients, the additional analyses from follow up of the patients and the results of those analyses were recorded using the follow-up forms.<br />RESULTS: One hundred and thirteen patients with suspected acute appendicitis were included in the study. Of the 113 patients (62 males, 51 females), the mean age was 30.2 Â± 10.1 (range 18-67) years. Of the 113 patients, 94 patients underwent surgery, while the rest were followed non-operatively. Of the 94 patients, 77 patients were histopathologically diagnosed with acute appendicitis.

"138","Is laparoscopy a safe approach for diffuse appendicular peritonitis? Feasibility and determination of risk factors for post-operative intra-abdominal abscess.","Surgical endoscopy","BACKGROUND: Several studies have assessed feasibility and early outcomes of the laparoscopic approach for complicated appendicitis (CA). However, these studies suffer from limitations due to the heterogeneous definitions used for CA. No studies have assessed feasibility and early post-operative outcomes of the laparoscopic approach in the specific management of diffuse appendicular peritonitis (DAP). Consequently, outcomes of the laparoscopic approach for the management of DAP are poorly documented.<br />METHODS: The laparoscopic approach is the first-line standardised procedure used by our team for the management of DAP. All patients (aged >16 years) who underwent laparoscopy for DAP (CA with the presence of purulent fluid with or without fibrin membranes in at least a hemi abdomen) between 2004 and 2012 were prospectively included. Post-operative outcomes were analysed according to the Clavien-Dindo classification.<br />RESULTS: Laparoscopy for DAP was performed for 141 patients. Mean age was 39.6 Â± 20 (16-92) years. A total of 45 patients (31.9%) had pre-operative contracture. The mean pre-operative leukocyte count was 14,900 Â± 4,380 mm(-3). The mean pre-operative C-reactive protein (CRP) serum concentration was 135 Â± 112 (2-418) mg/dl. The conversion rate was 3.5%. The mean operative time was 80 Â± 27 (20-180) min. There were no deaths. The rate of grade III morbidity was 6.5%. Ten patients (7.1%) experienced intra-abdominal abscess (IAA); seven of these cases were treated conservatively. The mean length of hospital stay was 6.9 Â± 5 (2-36) days. A pre-operative leukocyte count >17,000 mm(-3), and CRP serum concentration >200 mg/dl were significant predictive factors for IAA in multivariate analyses [odds ratio (OR) 25.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.4-250, p = 0.007 and OR 16.4, 95% CI 1.6-166, p = 0.02, respectively].<br />CONCLUSION: The laparoscopic approach for DAP is a safe and feasible procedure with a low conversion rate and an acceptable rate of IAA in view of the severity of the disease. Pre-operative leukocyte counts >17,000 mm(-3) and pre-operative CRP serum concentrations >200 mg/dl indicate a high risk of IAA.","24414463","2014","6"

The SCI patients who were recruited in the study had been diagnosed with AAE and treated medically or surgically while they were inpatients at the rehabilitation clinic.<br />RESULTS: Nine out of 237 SCI patients had been diagnosed with one of the AAE. Three patients were AIS A, three patients were AIS B and three patients were AIS C. The most common AAE was acute cholecystitis; three patients were diagnosed with this. The others were single cases of intra-abdominal hemorrhage, intra-abdominal abscess, tuba-ovarian abscess, subileus, Crohn's disease and cholangitis. Three of the patients were treated with surgery and six were treated medically. The most common symptoms in patients were fever, abdominal pain and abdominal discomfort (four of AAE). Three patients had abdominal tenderness and abdominal distension. The expected findings of AAE, rebound and defense, were positive only in two patients.<br />CONCLUSION: Gall bladder disease is a common cause of AAE. The classic symptoms and examination findings will usually not facilitate acute abdomen diagnosis in the SCI group, so we should be aware of patients' subjective complaints and when necessary use advanced imaging techniques immediately.","25000951","2014","9"

"142","An Evaluation of the Effect of Morphine on Abdominal Pain and PeritonealIrritation Signs in Patients with Acute Surgical Abdomen.","Journal of cardiovascular and thoracic research","INTRODUCTION: Acute surgical abdomen is one of the most common emergency surgical causes all over the world and also one of the most important abdominal pain causes which is sometimes intolerable for the patients referring to the emergency departments. Diagnosis and planning for operation in these cases is based on time-demanding serial examinations and results of paraclinical data. In this waiting period, patients have to tolerate pain.Therefore, we aimed to study the hypothesis that relieving pain has no influence on valuable findings in physical examination.<br />METHODS: This double blind randomized clinical trial was carried out on 120 patients above 12 years old referred to an emergency department of a referral hospital with acute abdomen. Patients were divided into two groups of receiving intravenous placebo and Morphine randomly. Pain score, change in tenderness as well as change in rebound tenderness before and after receiving morphine or placebo were measured based on Numeric Pain Assessment Scale.<br />RESULTS: Statistically significant difference was observed between both groups regarding the mean pain score. Prevalence of tenderness and rebound tenderness after medication administration revealed a significant difference between two groups. Furthermore, pain and tenderness showed a significant decrease in patients receiving morphine also a significant difference occurred in rebound tenderness between two groups.<br />CONCLUSION: Despite the fact that opioid analgesics decrease pain in patients with acute surgical abdomen, they do not tend to eliminate required diagnostic data being obtained from physical examination like tenderness and rebound tenderness. Surprisingly, all the acute abdomen cases had rebound tenderness after morphine administration. Therefore, this research advises a cautious usage of morphine in patients with acute abdomen.","24250982","2012",\N

The website, PEMguidelines.org contains educational sections geared toward both clinicians and patients and families. The site provides evidenced based guidelines for the management of head trauma and appendicitis. PEMguidelines.org was rolled out in 2012 as part of a three pronged intervention strategy. A linkto the website was included in new clinical order-sets within the Fairview electronic health system. Clinical decision support aids were also embedded in the medical record system. Fairview held provider education sessions for ED physicians and staff to introduce and promote the new approach. Results from a six month period after the initial roll out indicate a decrease of 15% in abdominal CT scans for suspected appendicitis cases, while the numbers of missed cases did not increase.This initial evidence supports the effectiveness of this multilevel strategy in improving the safety and cost-effectiveness of pediatric CT use in diagnosis of appendicitis.","25004681",\N,\N

Laparoscopy is changing the view regarding exploration in patients with chronic right lower quadrant pain. Of recent, chronic or recurrent right lower quadrant pain is an entity that has generated much interest, hence this study has been undertaken. To study the role of elective laparoscopic appendicectomy for chronic or recurrent right lower quadrant pain. To study the relationship between clinical improvement and histopathological findings of removed appendix. Forty three cases of chronic right lower quadrant pain, who met the inclusion criteria, were included in the clinical study. Three cases were excluded during initial diagnostic laparoscopy because of ovarian cyst. Laparoscopic appendicectomy was performed in 40 cases. In our study amongst 40 (100Â %) patients, 36(90Â %) patients were relieved of pain completely. Only 4(10Â %) patients continued to have persistent right lower quadrant pain. Duration of follow up was 6Â months. Postoperative pain scores favour appendicectomy (pâ€‰<â€‰0.005). There was no association between postoperative pain scores and histopathology findings. There was no mortality in our study. Persistent or recurrent right lower quadrant pain can be treated successfully by elective laparoscopic appendicectomy in properly selected cases. Laparoscopic appendectomy is a feasible and safe procedure. Histopathology of the removed appendix does not contribute to the diagnosis.","24426475","2013","10"

Alvarado, Eskelinen, Lintula and Ohmann scores were calculated separately for each patient at the time of admission. The specificity, sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values of the scores were calculated. The predictive value of the scores was evaluated with the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the consistency among the scores by Kappa test.<br />RESULTS: Twenty of the patients were female (33.3 %). The mean age of the patients was 9.9 years (3-16 years). Forty two patients were operated and appendectomies were performed with the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The area under the ROC curve showed that the scores had no predictive value in diagnosing acute appendicitis. Kappa test showed that agreement between the scores was not good.<br />CONCLUSION: The sensitivity and specificity of the four scoring systems were not sufficient enough in diagnosing acute appendicitis in our patient group. We concluded that the most important factor affecting the decision for surgery in suspected acute appendicitis is the surgeon's experience combined with physical findings of repeated clinical examinations.","24448910","2014","3"

Complicated appendicitis was considered present when the appendix was gangrenous, perforated, phlegmonous and/or associated with a peri-appendiceal abscess. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 19.<br />RESULTS: Appendectomies were performed by one of three surgeons in 167 patients (mean case volume 11 cases per surgeon per year) at mean age of 31.8 Â±9.67 years and mean BMI of 29.3 Â± 2.59 Kg/m(2). There was a 14% negative appendectomy rate. Of 143 patients with confirmed appendicitis, 73% were uncomplicated cases and 24% were complicated appendicitis. The mean operating time was 50.1 Â±18.4 minutes for uncomplicated cases and 98.8 Â±21.6 minutes for complicated appendicitis. The overall morbidity rate was 4.2% (1.8% morbidity in uncomplicated cases and 14.7% for complicated appendicitis. Post-operatively, 69% patients required no supplemental parenteral opioids.

From January 2007 to March 2011, a series of 35 patients who underwent MDCTA of the abdomen and pelvis and had surgery were included. The reports of the initial CT were retrospectively compared with the discharge diagnosis and surgical reports. Discrepant or missing findings were re-evaluated and divided into relevant or not relevant regarding the diagnosis. In 23 of the 35 patients (66 %), all findings were correctly diagnosed in the initial MDCTA report. In the remaining 12 of the 35 patients (34 %), lesions that were not reported were present at surgery. In 10 of the 12 (83 %) patients, the overlooked findings were relevant and subtle: gas in the portal vein (nâ€‰=â€‰3), gas in the bowel wall (nâ€‰=â€‰3), gas in the portal vein and bowel wall (nâ€‰=â€‰2), thrombotic occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (nâ€‰=â€‰1), and thrombotic occlusion of the inferior mesenteric artery (nâ€‰=â€‰1). In 2 of the 12 (17 %) patients in whom the MDCTA-overlooked findings were classified as non-relevant, bowel ischemia was found at surgery. With retrospective image interpretation, 83 % of the patients with occlusive mesenteric ischemia at surgery were correctly identified, whereas the remaining 17 % with non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia at surgery showed non-relevant findings at MDCTA. About 33 % of relevant findings of bowel ischemia were overlooked by the initial MDCTA interpretation, most were subtle findings.

"150","Ectopic spleen: An easily identifiable but commonly undiagnosed entity until manifestation of complications.","International journal of surgery case reports","INTRODUCTION: Ectopic spleen is an uncommon clinical entity as splenectomy for treatment of ectopic spleens accounts for less than 0.25% of splenectomies. The most common age of presentation is childhood especially under 1 year of age followed by the third decade of life.<br />PRESENTATION OF CASE: The present report refers to a patient with torsion of a pelvic spleen treated with splenectomy. The patient exhibited a period of vague intermittent lower abdominal pain lasted 65 days followed by a period of constant left lower quadrant pain of increasing severity lasted 6 days. On the first 65 days, vague pain was attributed to progressive torsion of the spleen which resulted in venous congestion. On the last 6 days, exacerbation of pain was attributed to irreducible torsion, infraction of the arterial supply, acute ischemia, strangulation and rupture of the gangrenous spleen. Diagnosis was made by CT which revealed absence of the spleen in its normal position, a homogeneous pelvic mass with no contrast enhancement, free blood in the peritoneal cavity, and confirmed by laparotomy.<br />DISCUSSION: Clinical manifestations of ectopic spleen vary from asymptomatic to abdominal emergency. Symptoms are most commonly attributed to complications related to torsion. Operative management, including splenopexy or splenectomy, is the treatment of choice in uncomplicated and complicated cases because conservative treatment of an asymptomatic ectopic spleen is associated with a complication rate of 65%.<br />CONCLUSION: Although an ectopic spleen can be easily identified on clinical examination, it is commonly misdiagnosed until the manifestation of complications in adulthood.","24973525","2014",\N

The patients had laparoscopic operations in our hospital in the period from January 1995 to December 2012. The clinical picture, laboratory and instrumental datas in cases of epiploic appendices torsion and necrosis were scarce and nonspecific. An abdominal pain preferentially localized in the lower divisions was the main symptom (97.7%). The instrumental methods did not allow to diagnose the torsion and necrosis of epiploic appendices in the majority of cases and all these techniques were used for the differential diagnosis with other diseases. The assumption of the presence of appendices torsion and necrosis occured just in 34.5% of cases before the operation. Diagnosis of epiploic appendices torsion and necrosis present significant difficulties on prehospital and preoperative stages. The diagnostic laparoscopy is the method of choice in unclear situations and it allows to diagnose the torsion and necrosis of epiploic appendices in 96.6% of cases.

Cases of complicated appendicitis confirmed on imaging tools and patients over 3 points on the American Society of Anesthesia score were excluded.<br />RESULTS: Among the total of 89 patients, there were 51 patients in the TULA group and 38 patients in the CTLA group. The visual analogue scale (VAS) of postoperative day (POD) #1 was higher in the TULA group than in the CTLA group (P = 0.048). The operative time and other variables had no statistical significances (P > 0.05).<br />CONCLUSION: Despite the insufficiency of instruments and the difficulty of handling, TULA was not worse in operative time, VAS after POD #2, and the total operative cost than CTLA. And, if there are no disadvantages of TULA, TULA may be suitable in substituting three-port laparoscopic surgery and could be considered as one field of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery with the improvement and development of the instruments and revised studies.","23908963","2013","8"

Numerous case reports describing the clinical course in this setting are available but there is no concise guideline. The aim of the present study was to develop practical guidelines to aid clinicians in the diagnosis and management of acute tooth pick ingestion.<br />METHOD: Our Medline search identified 116 publications containing case reports of ingested toothpicks. We then performed a retrospective analysis of patients' characteristics, medical history, diagnostics, therapy, and clinical outcome.<br />RESULTS: A total of 136 cases (74 % male, age 52 [5-92] years) have been reported in the literature. From the available information, more than 50 % (n = 48) of patients were not aware of having swallowed a toothpick. The most common presenting symptoms were abdominal pain (82 %), fever (39 %), and nausea (31 %). The toothpick caused gut perforation in 79 % of all patients. The locations of toothpicks prior removal were esophagus (2 %), stomach (20 %), duodenum (23 %), small intestine (18 %), and large intestine (37 %). The diagnostic procedures included endoscopy (63 %), computed tomography scan (63 %), and ultrasound (47 %); however, in 35 % of cases these investigations failed to detect the toothpick. Therapy was surgery in most cases (58 %). The overall mortality was 9.6 %.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Toothpick ingestion is a medical emergency. Perforations of the intestine are common and the associated mortality is high. Adequate therapy depends on localization of the toothpick in the gastrointestinal tract. Ingested toothpicks should be kept in mind as an important differential diagnosis in patients with acute abdomen.","24166027","2014","2"

Our specific aim was to determine the prevalence of SIRS at the time of presentation of pediatric patients with appendicitis. Additionally, we sought to determine if the presence of SIRS had any value in predicting their clinical outcomes.<br />METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included pediatric patients (age <17 years) presenting to a single hospital and being diagnosed with appendicitis between July 1, 2011, and June 30, 2012. The primary exposure variable of interest was SIRS, dichotomously defined as positive or negative. The primary outcome of interest was the presence/development of an intraabdominal abscess. The secondary outcome of interest was length of hospital stay (LOS). Chi-squared and t-tests were used to evaluate the association between presence of SIRS and development of abscess and LOS.<br />RESULTS: This study consisted of 212 patients. The definition of SIRS was met in 66 patients (31.1%). Thirty of the 66 (45.6%) patients with SIRS had/developed an abscess versus 28 (19.2%) of those without SIRS (P<0.001). Patients with SIRS had a mean LOS of 4 days (+/-2.7), while those without SIRS stayed a mean of 2.5 days (+/-2.3) [p<0.0001]). Adjusting for age did not alter these associations.<br />CONCLUSION: Our study found a 31.1% prevalence of SIRS in pediatric patients presenting with appendicitis.

"157","Evaluation of a novel pediatric appendicitis pathway using high- and low-risk scoring systems.","Pediatric emergency care","OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the test characteristics of a pathway for pediatric appendicitis and its effects on emergency department (ED) length of stay, imaging, and admissions.<br />METHODS: Children age 3 to 18 years with suspicion for appendicitis at 1 tertiary care ED were prospectively enrolled, using validated low- and high-risk scoring systems incorporating history, physical examination, and white blood cell count. Low-risk patients were discharged or observed in the ED. High-risk patients were admitted. Those meeting neither low-risk nor high-risk criteria were evaluated by surgery, with imaging at their discretion. Chart review or telephone follow-up was conducted 2 weeks after the visit. A retrospective study before and after was also performed. Charts of a random sample of patients evaluated for appendicitis in the 8 months before and after the pathway implementation were reviewed.<br />RESULTS: Appendicitis was diagnosed in 65 of 178 patients. Of those with appendicitis, 63 were not low-risk (sensitivity, 96.9%; specificity, 40.7%). The high-risk criteria had a sensitivity of 75.3% and specificity of 75.2%. We reviewed 292 visits before and 290 after the pathway implementation. Emergency department length of stay was similar (253 minutes before vs 257 minutes after, P = 0.77). Computed tomography was used in 12.7% of visits before and 6.9% of visits after (P = 0.02). Use of ultrasound was not significantly different (47.3% vs 53.7%). Admission rates were not significantly different (45.5% vs 42.7%).<br />CONCLUSIONS: The low-risk criteria had good sensitivity in ruling out appendicitis. The high-risk criteria could be used to guide referral or admission. Neither outperformed the a priori judgment of experienced providers.","24076607","2013","10"
"158","Importance of clinical assessment in diagnosis of acute appendicitis and its role in decreasing negative appendicectomy rate.","Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad : JAMC","BACKGROUND: Appendicitis is a common diagnosis, but is by no means a simple one to establish. It is impractical to have a definitive preoperative diagnosis, which leads to an appreciable rate of negative appendicectomy as reported in world literature varying from 20-40% with its morbidity around 10%. This retrospective study investigated the value of clinical assessment and medical imaging (ultrasonography) for patients with suspected appendicitis. Negative appendicectomy rate and appendiceal perforation with or without medical imaging were used as end points for this investigation.<br />METHODS: This study reviewed all patients admitted in Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zaid Hospital with suspected acute appendicitis. The patient cohort was identified from the unit registry and review of medical records. The medical records were analysed, and the outcomes of patients were followed up.<br />RESULTS: Between June 2010 to June 2012, 375 patients' medical records were audited. These included 56.3% males and 43.7% females. The negative appendicitis rate was 7.2% and appendiceal perforation rate was 5.3%. Ultrasound was done in 103 (27.4%) patients in whom diagnosis of appendicitis was doubtful. Medical imaging had a 50% prediction rate for acute appendicitis, 40% false-negative rate, and 10% false-positive rate. Overall, the prediction rate for appendicitis by clinical assessment supplemented by laboratory tests and medical imaging at clinician's discretion was 92.8%.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Despite studies advocating routine use of medical imaging for patients with suspected acute appendicitis, this study showed that the clinical evaluation is still paramount to the management of patients with suspected acute appendicitis before considering medical imaging.","24397040",\N,\N

From those, 118 underwent appendiceal stump closure by metal endoclip. The patient's age ranged from 12 to 75Â years old (31.7â€‰Â±â€‰13.3) and 52.7% were male. Complicated appendicitis refers to gangrenous and/or perforated appendix, which may lead to abscess formation and degrees of peritonitis. The outcomes viability, operative time, infection complication, operative complications, and conversion rate were chosen to evaluate the procedure.<br />RESULTS: The appendiceal stump closure by metal endoclip was used in 90% of cases. The presence of appendix base necrosis was the most important factor involved in failure of the procedure. Laparoscopic knot (1.5%), laparoscopic endo-suture (3.8%) and video assisted laparotomy (4.7%) were the alternatives used in difficult cases. The mean operative time was (67.54â€‰Â±â€‰28.13Â minutes). The wound and intra-abdominal infection rates were 2.54% and 5.08%, respectively. There were no operative complications and the conversion rate was 0.85%.<br />CONCLUSION: The appendiceal stump closure by metal endoclip, in complicated grades of acute appendicitis, is a safe and effective procedure. In patients with appendix base necrosis it should be avoided in favor of other alternatives.","24047531","2013",\N

Appendiceal perforation and advanced imaging rates were compared between ethnic and language proficiency groups using simple and multivariate regression models.<br />RESULTS: Of 2590 patients enrolled, 1001 (38%) had appendicitis, including 36% of non-Hispanics and 44% of Hispanics. In multivariate modeling, Hispanics with LEP had a significantly greater odds of appendiceal perforation (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.20-1.74). Hispanics with LEP with appendiceal perforation of moderate clinical severity were less likely to undergo advanced imaging compared with English-speaking non-Hispanics (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.43-0.95).<br />CONCLUSION: Hispanic ethnicity with LEP is an important risk factor for appendiceal perforation in pediatric patients brought to the emergency department with possible appendicitis. Among patients with moderate clinical severity, Hispanic ethnicity with LEP appears to be associated with lower imaging rates. This effect of English proficiency and Hispanic ethnicity warrants further investigation to understand and overcome barriers, which may lead to increased appendiceal perforation rates and differential diagnostic evaluation.","24565425","2014","6"
"161","Imaging for acute pelvic pain in pregnancy.","Insights into imaging","Acute pelvic pain in pregnancy presents diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Standard imaging techniques need to be adapted to reduce harm to the foetus from X-rays because of their teratogenic and carcinogenic potential. Ultrasound remains the primary imaging investigation of the pregnant abdomen. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to be useful in the diagnosis of gynaecological and obstetric problems during pregnancy and in the setting of acute abdomen during pregnancy. MRI overcomes some of the limitations of ultrasound, mainly the size of the gravid uterus. MRI poses theoretical risks to the foetus and care must be taken to minimise these with the avoidance of contrast agents.

The operation was performed under general anesthesia in all 26 patients in the LA group and in 10 (24%) in the OA group. Patient characteristics, operative factors, and postoperative complications (especially postoperative intraabdominal abscess) were compared between the two groups. Management of postoperative intraabdominal abscess was also investigated.<br />RESULTS: Postoperative intraabdominal abscess occurred in 3 patients (12%) in the LA group and in 10 (24%) in the OA group (p = 0.23). All 3 patients in the LA group were treated conservatively. Of the 10 patients in the OA group, 6 were treated conservatively, but 4 needed a reoperation, including 3 who had undergone right pararectal skin incision under spinal analgesia and in whom sufficient irrigation was not possible because anesthesia had worn off.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that insertion of abdominal drainage may be appropriate treatment for intraabdominal abscess after laparoscopic appendectomy. Light anesthesia may induce residual abscess in open appendectomy performed under spinal analgesia.","23909076","2013","6"

Children assigned an International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision code consistent with constipation were eligible. Misdiagnosis was defined as an alternative diagnosis during the subsequent 7 days that resulted in hospitalization or an outpatient procedure that included a surgical or radiologic intervention. Constipation severity was classified employing text word categorization and the Leech score.<br />RESULTS: 3685 eligible visits were identified. Mean age was 6.6 Â± 4.4 years. AXR was performed in 46% (1693/3685). Twenty misdiagnoses (0.5%; 95% CI 0.4, 0.8) were identified (appendicitis [7%], intussusception [2%, bowel obstruction [2%], other [9%]). AXR was performed more frequently in misdiagnosed children (75% vs 46%; P = .01). These children more often had abdominal pain (70% vs 49%; P = .04) and tenderness (60% vs 32%; P =.01). Children in both groups had similar amounts of stool on AXR (P = .38) and mean Leech scores (misdiagnosed = 7.9 Â± 3.4; not misdiagnosed = 7.7 Â± 2.9; P = .85).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Misdiagnoses in children with constipation are more frequent in those in whom an AXR was performed and those with abdominal pain and tenderness. The performance of an AXR may indicate diagnostic uncertainty; in such cases, the presence of stool on AXR does not rule out an alternative diagnosis.","24128647","2014","1"

After initial evaluation, patients were determined to be at low (PAS 1-3), intermediate (PAS 4-7), or high (PAS 8-10) risk for appendicitis. Low-risk patients were discharged with telephone follow-up. High-risk patients received immediate surgical consultation. Patients at intermediate risk for appendicitis underwent US.<br />RESULTS: Of the 196 patients enrolled, 65 (33.2%) had appendicitis. An initial PAS of 1-3 was noted in 44 (22.4%), 4-7 in 119 (60.7%), and 8-10 in 33 (16.9%) patients. Ultrasonography was performed in 128 (65.3%) patients, and 48 (37.5%) were positive. An abdominal computed tomography scan was requested by the surgical consultants in 13 (6.6%) patients. The negative appendectomy rate was 3 of 68 (4.4%). Follow-up was established on 190 of 196 (96.9%) patients. Overall diagnostic accuracy of the pathway was 94% (95% confidence interval [CI] 91%-97%) with a sensitivity of 92.3% (95% CI 83.0%-97.5%), specificity of 94.7% (95% CI 89.3%-97.8%), likelihood ratio (+) 17.3 (95% CI 8.4-35.6) and likelihood ratio (-) 0.08 (95% CI 0.04-0.19).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Our protocol demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of appendicitis in children.

Part A","BACKGROUND: In recent years, single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy has been used as an improved form of conventional laparoscopic appendectomy (CLA). We have started to perform gasless laparoscopy-assisted transumbilical appendectomy (GLATUA) in patients with uncomplicated appendicitis. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, safety, cosmetic results, and cost-effectiveness of this novel technique of GLATUA.<br />PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 30 patients with a diagnosis of acute appendicitis without evidence of periappendiceal abcess or perforation and indicated for operation were enrolled in the study. Attempts to operate by the GLATUA technique initially were made in all of the patients. When it was technically difficult to perform appendix extraction via the umbilicus, the procedures were converted to the CLA technique (conversion group). The following factors between the successful group and conversion group were investigated to evaluate feasibility and predictable factors for the success of GLATUA: age, gender, duration from symptom onset to hospital visit, preoperative ileus, preoperative white blood cell count, neutrophil count (%), body mass index, fat infiltration in abdominal computed tomography or ultrasonography, pathologic characteristics of the resected appendix, and postoperative complications.<br />RESULTS: Among the 30 patients, 19 patients underwent operation by the GLATUA technique (63.3%). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of demographics, duration from symptom onset to hospital visit, preoperative white blood cell count, neutrophil count (%), and pathologic characteristics of the appendix. Significant differences were observed between the two groups for preoperative ileus in simple abdominal x-ray and fat infiltration in preoperative diagnostic modality. There were no postoperative complications in both groups.<br />CONCLUSIONS: GLATUA is a feasible, safe, and cost-effective technique for appendectomy in uncomplicated appendicitis and shows good cosmetic results. It did not increase the rate of complications and represents a possible alternative to the CLA technique in cases without fat infiltration in abdominal tomography or ultrasonography and small bowel ileus in simple abdominal x-ray.","24960173","2014","8"

Recent studies show that a high level of serum bilirubin could emerge as a prognostic marker for gangrenous or perforated stages of acute appendicitis. We studied the correlations between anatomical and pathological stages of acute appendicitis and white blood cell count, serum total bilirubin, and indirect serum bilirubin on a large series of cases, in the course of one year, in our department. Although there being a correlation between severe forms of acute appendicitis (gangrenous, perforated), elevated white blood cell count, elevated serum bilirubin (mostly the indirect fraction), none of the indicators proved to have a definitive diagnostic value. Cases with perforation and localized generalized peritonitis are more frequently associated with elevated bilirubin levels.","24331322",\N,\N
"169","Preoperative C-reactive protein predicts the severity and likelihood of complications following appendicectomy.","Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England","INTRODUCTION: Diagnostic laparoscopy with appendicectomy (LA) has become the accepted method of investigation and treatment of appendicitis. However, concerns remain in cases of complicated appendicitis when many advocate conversion to an open procedure (LCOA) owing to the risk of complications. The aim of this study was to look for factors that could predict complications occurring in patients undergoing appendicectomy.<br />METHODS: Data inclusive of all consecutive appendicectomies over a two-year period were retrieved from the computerised theatre database. Clinical details including admission inflammatory markers, complications, severity (final pathology) and length of stay were collected from the discharge letter. Readmissions were identified as those hospital identifiers had a second set of admission dates and/or a second discharge letter.<br />RESULTS: During the 2-year study period, 517 appendicectomies were performed. Of these, 429 patients (83%) had LA and the remaining 88 (17%) had LCOA. The LA group had a mean age of 28 years (range: 2-86 years) and a mean C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 71 mg/l (range: 0-480 mg/l) while the LCOA group had a mean age of 46 years (range: 11-92 years) and a mean CRP level of 162 mg/l (range: 3-404 mg/l). These differences in age and CRP were significant (p<0.001). LA patients were less likely to have complications overall (22% vs 52%, p=0.015). Complications were independently more than twice as common with established inflammation with a CRP level of >150 mg/l (p<0.05).<br />CONCLUSIONS: A high preoperative CRP level predicts an increased rate of postoperative complication due to established inflammation and/or infection. This raises the question of whether we should be offering primary open appendicectomies to patients with a CRP level of >150 mg/l.","24992421","2014","7"
"170","The accuracy of pre-appendectomy computed tomography with histopathological correlation: a clinical audit, case discussion and evaluation of the literature.","Emergency radiology","The increasing use of computed tomography (CT) in acute appendicitis makes recognising the radiological hallmarks of the condition and its mimics vital. The differential diagnosis includes both appendiceal and nonappendiceal pathologies. The correlation between pre-appendectomy CT and post-appendectomy histopathology was audited retrospectively. Cases of clinico-histopathological discrepancy underwent blind peer-review, and possible improvements were discussed in the context of the medical literature. A grade for discrepancy was given based on the RADPEER scoring system, and interesting or discrepant cases were examined more closely to identify targets for education. Of the 199 procedures, 4 appendectomies were negative (histologically normal), 182 were positive (primary appendicitis) and 13 were incidental (another primary process caused inflammation). The positive predictive value for pre-appendectomy CT was 91.5Â %, and the negative appendectomy rate was 2Â %. There were many secondary pathologies, including neoplasia, tuberculosis and endometriosis. Although no CT reports missed a diagnosis that should be made \"almost all of the time\" and in 96Â % of cases, the second, blinded radiologist agreed with the initial assessment, in 3 cases, a missed diagnosis altered clinical management; 2 were \"understandable\" misses but 1 was not. In five cases, a discrepancy was \"understandable\" but clinically insignificant. Overall, in comparison to the medical literature, the degree of clinico-histopathological correlation was good. Although identifying areas for improvement was challenging, after a pictorial review of four cases and a discussion of the medical literature, we present our audit results and some valuable learning points for use in the CT assessment of suspected acute appendicitis.","24879063","2014","12"

American journal of roentgenology","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess whether the availability of clinicobiologic findings would affect the diagnostic performance of CT of elderly emergency department patients with nontraumatic acute abdominal pain.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cases of 333 consecutively registered patients 75 years old or older presenting to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain and who underwent CT were retrospectively reviewed by two radiologists blinded or not to the patient's clinicobiologic results. Diagnostic accuracy was calculated according to the level of correctly classified cases in both the entire cohort and a surgical subgroup and was compared between readings performed with and without knowledge of the clinicobiologic findings. Agreement between each reading and the reference diagnosis and interobserver agreement were assessed with kappa statistics.<br />RESULTS: In both the entire cohort (87.4% vs 85.3%, p = 0.07) and the surgical group (94% vs 91%, p = 0.15), there was no significant difference in CT accuracy between diagnoses made when the radiologist was aware and those made when the radiologist was not aware of the clinicobiologic findings. Agreement between the CT diagnosis and the final diagnosis was excellent whether or not the radiologist was aware of the clinicobiologic findings.<br />CONCLUSION: In the care of elderly patients, CT is accurate for diagnosing the cause of acute abdominal pain, particularly when it is of surgical origin, regardless of the availability of clinical and biologic findings. Thus CT interpretation should not be delayed until complete clinicobiologic data are available, and the images should be quickly transmitted to the emergency physician so that appropriate therapy can be begun.","24261352","2013","12"

Utilizing formal quality improvement methods, an evidenced based guideline was implemented at our institution.<br />METHODS: A guideline was established regarding timing of surgery (immediate vs interval appendectomy) and duration of antibiotics. Twelve months of baseline data were collected prior to implementation. The guideline dictates immediate appendectomy (IA) and postoperative antibiotic therapy until discharge (regular diet, clinically improved, normal complete blood count (CBC)). Data was collected prospectively during hospitalization and at 30days postdischarge. Control charts document adherence to the overall guideline, IA, antibiotic guideline, and readmission for complications.<br />RESULTS: Guideline implementation resulted in an increase in IA (79% vs 94%), decrease in the use of IV antibiotics post discharge (25% to 4%), no change in overall LOS, no change in postoperative abscess formation, and slight decrease in 30day readmission. Charges were decreased.<br />CONCLUSION: Implementation of an evidenced based guideline resulted in significant practice change for managing perforated appendicitis. The changes suggest more efficient care without compromising patient outcome. Utilization of quality improvement methods allows for implementing and tracking the change as well as creating a platform for future improvement.","24888855","2014","6"

During a 12-month period at two urban teaching hospitals, 6,409 ED abdominopelvic (AP) CTs were performed to evaluate acute abdominal pain. NOCAPE represented 70.9Â % of all ED AP CT examinations with intravenous contrast. Data collection included patient demographics, use of intravenous (IV) and/or oral contrast, order to complete and order to final interpretation TAT, ED LOS, admission, recall and bounce back rates, and comparison and characterization of impressions. The NOCAPE pathway reduced median order to complete TAT by 32Â min (22.9Â %) compared to IV and oral contrast AP CT examinations (traditional pathway) (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Median order to final TAT was 2.9Â h in NOCAPE patients and 3.5Â h in the traditional pathway, a 36-min (17.1Â %) reduction (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Overall, the NOCAPE pathway reduced ED LOS by a median of 43Â min (8.8Â %) compared to the traditional pathway (8.2 vs 7.5Â h) (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.003). Recall and bounce back rates were 3.2Â %, and only one patient had change in impression after oral contrast CT was repeated. The NOCAPE pathway is associated with decreased radiology TAT and ED LOS metrics. The authors suggest that NOCAPE implementation in the ED setting is safe and positively impacts both radiology and emergency medicine workflow.","24902657","2014","12"

Two board-certified radiologists reviewed the original images independently and recorded the incidental findings. These findings were classified as benign, indeterminate, and worrisome. Only those findings present in the original report were included in the study. If an indeterminate or worrisome incidental finding was identified, the patient's medical records were reviewed to determine if the incidental finding was previously known, whether recommendation was made for further evaluation, and whether this recommendation led to any change in management.<br />RESULTS: We identified 283 incidental findingsâ€”144 benign (51%), 114 indeterminate (40%), and 25 worrisome (9%) findings. A statistically significant difference was observed in the percentage of patients who experienced a change in management among those who received recommendations as compared with those who did not, in both previously known (87% vs 22%, P=.001) and previously unknown (70% vs 2%, P=.001) indeterminate findings.<br />CONCLUSION: Unlike benign incidental findings, indeterminate and worrisome findings frequently alter the course of management. Recommendation from radiologists appears to significantly contribute to the management of indeterminate incidental findings.","24475484","2014","1"

Procalcitonin is a biochemical marker that increases rapidly in cases of bacterial infection and sepsis; however, the benefit of PCT as a diagnostic tool in acute appendicitis has not been confirmed.<br />METHODS: Observations of PCT dynamics were conducted as part of a prospective clinical trial at Sahlgrenska University Hospital between May 2009 and February 2010 on adult patients with acute appendicitis treated with antibiotics as first-line therapy. Procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and white blood cell count (WBC) were measured before administration of antibiotics and subsequently between 4-24â€‰h following treatment.<br />RESULTS: Three hundred sixteen patients were included in the study. Almost 80% recovered on antibiotics without the need of surgery. Serum PCT concentrations before initiation of antibiotic therapy and during treatment did not differ significantly between antibiotic responders and non-responders (p<0.94). However, differences were observed for CRP (p<0.04) and WBC (p<0.001), with a trend for body temperature (p<0.06).<br />CONCLUSION: Procalcitonin has limited additional value, compared with standard laboratory tests as CRP, WBC, and body temperature to predict antibiotic treatment response in adult patients with acute appendicitis.","24865123","2014","10"
"180","The NOTA Study (Non Operative Treatment for Acute Appendicitis): prospective study on the efficacy and safety of antibiotics (amoxicillin and clavulanic acid) for treating patients with right lower quadrant abdominal pain and long-term follow-up of conservatively treated suspected appendicitis.","Annals of surgery","OBJECTIVES: To assess the safety and efficacy of antibiotics treatment for suspected acute uncomplicated appendicitis and to monitor the long term follow-up of non-operated patients.<br />BACKGROUND: Right lower quadrant abdominal pain is a common cause of emergency department admission. The natural history of acute appendicitis nonoperatively treated with antibiotics remains unclear.<br />METHODS: In 2010, a total of 159 patients [mean AIR (Appendicitis Inflammatory Response) score = 4.9 and mean Alvarado score = 5.2] with suspected appendicitis were enrolled and underwent nonoperative management (NOM) with amoxicillin/clavulanate. The follow-up period was 2 years.<br />RESULTS: Short-term (7 days) NOM failure rate was 11.9%. All patients with initial failures were operated within 7 days. At 15 days, no recurrences were recorded. After 2 years, the overall recurrence rate was 13.8% (22/159); 14 of 22 patients were successfully treated with further cycle of amoxicillin/clavulanate. No major side effects occurred. Abdominal pain assessed by the Numeric Rating Scale and the visual analog scale; median Numeric Rating Scale score was 3 at 5 days and 2 after 7 days. Mean length of stay of nonoperatively managed patients was 0.4 days, and mean sick leave period was 5.8 days. Long-term efficacy of NOM treatment was 83% (118 patients recurrence free and 14 patients with recurrence nonoperatively managed). None of the single factors forming the Alvarado or AIR score were independent predictors of failure of NOM or long-term recurrence. Alvarado and AIR scores were the only independent predictive factors of NOM failure after multivariate analysis, but both did not correlate with recurrences. Overall costs of NOM and antibiotics were &OV0556;316.20 per patient.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotics for suspected acute appendicitis are safe and effective and may avoid unnecessary appendectomy, reducing operation rate, surgical risks, and overall costs. After 2 years of follow-up, recurrences of nonoperatively treated right lower quadrant abdominal pain are less than 14% and may be safely and effectively treated with further antibiotics.","24646528","2014","7"
"181","Endoscopic ultrasound, the one-stop shop for abdominal pain?","United European gastroenterology journal","The Endosonography for Right Sided and Acute Upper Intestinal Misery (EFRAIM) study indicates that the yield of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is equivalent if not superior to upper endoscopy combined with transabdominal ultrasound in patients presenting with acute discomfort. Furthermore, this strategy may be more cost effective as EUS simultaneously enables assessment of intraluminal disease as well as extra intestinal pathology. These results are in sync with prior studies demonstrating the hegemony of EUS in the assessment of pancreaticobiliary disease and its role in the assessment of enigmatic chronic abdominal pain. Nevertheless, EUS does not permit assessment for appendicitis or genitourinary catastrophe. Thus a careful history and physical examination to localize pain to the right upper quadrant and epigastrium is essential.","24917979","2013","10"

"183","The effect of point-of-care ultrasonography on emergency department length of stay and computed tomography utilization in children with suspected appendicitis.","Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine","OBJECTIVES: The role of clinician-performed ultrasonography (US) for suspected appendicitis is unclear. Published data conclude that US has high specificity to rule in the diagnosis of appendicitis, with variable sensitivity to rule it out. Newer data suggest that point-of-care (POC) US may have similar test characteristics. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of POC US in children with suspected appendicitis and its effect on emergency department (ED) length of stay (LOS) and computed tomography (CT) utilization.<br />METHODS: This was a prospective observational convenience sample of children with suspected appendicitis requiring imaging evaluation that adhered to the Standards for the Reporting of Diagnostic accuracy studies (STARD) criteria. Outcomes were determined by operative or pathology report in those who had appendicitis, and 3-week phone follow-up in those patients who were nonoperative. Differences in ED LOS were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) between patients who received dispositions after POC US, radiology US, or CT. Test performance characteristics were calculated for all imaging modalities.<br />RESULTS: Among 150 enrolled patients, 50 had appendicitis (33.3%). There were no missed cases of appendicitis in discharged patients at 3-week phone follow-up, nor negative laparotomies in those who went to the operating room. Those who had dispositions after POC US (nÂ =Â 25) had a significantly decreased mean ED LOS (154Â minutes, 95% confidence interval [CI]Â =Â 115 to 193Â minutes) compared with those requiring radiology US (288Â minutes, 95% CIÂ =Â 257 to 319Â minutes) or CT scan (487Â minutes; 95% CIÂ =Â 434 to 540Â minutes). Baseline CT rate was 44.2% (95% CIÂ =Â 30.7% to 57.7%) prior to study start and decreased to 27.3% (95% CIÂ =Â 20.17% to 34.43%) during the study. CTs were avoided in four patients with conclusive POC US results and inconclusive radiology US results. The sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR+), and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) forÂ POC US wereÂ 60% (95% CIÂ =Â 46% to 72%), 94% (95% CIÂ =Â 88% to 97%), 10 (95% CIÂ =Â 4 to 23), and 0.4 (95% CIÂ =Â 0.3 to 0.6). For radiology US they were 63% (95% CIÂ =Â 48% to 75%), 99% (95% CIÂ =Â 94% to 99%), 94 (95% CIÂ =Â 6 to 1,500), and 0.4 (95% CIÂ =Â 0.3 to 0.6); and for CT they were 83% (95% CIÂ =Â 58% to 95%), 98% (95% CIÂ =Â 85% to 99%), 45 (95% CIÂ =Â 3 to 707), and 0.2 (95% CIÂ =Â 0.05 to 0.5).<br />CONCLUSIONS: It may be feasible to reduce ED LOS and avoid CT scan when using POC US to evaluate children with suspected appendicitis. Test characteristics for POC US have high specificity to rule in appendicitis, similar to radiology US. Addition of POC US prior to sequential radiology imaging was safe, without missed cases of appendicitis or negative laparotomies.","24673672","2014","2"

Efforts have been undertaken for the development of minimally invasive techniques that reduce tissue trauma and offer improved cosmetic results, one of such being the single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS).<br />AIM: To present a minimally invasive technique for appendectomy (SILS) undertaken with conventional instruments.<br />METHOD: Eleven patients were treated in the emergency care center presenting abdominal pain in the right iliac fossa that was suggestive of appendicitis. Diagnostic investigation was subsequently conducted, including physical examination, laboratory and imaging exams (CT scan with intravenous contrast or total abdominal ultrasound), and the results were consistent with acute appendicitis. Thus, after consent, these patients underwent SILS appendectomy under general anesthesia with three trocars (two 10 mm and one 5 mm), using conventional and optical laparoscopic tweezers (10 mm, 30Âº). The base and pedicle of the appendix were ligated with titanium LT 400 clips. The procedure occurred uneventfully. Inclusion criteria were absence of diffuse peritonitis, BMI (body mass index) less than 35 and absence of serious comorbidities or sepsis.<br />RESULTS: Seven men and four women were operated with average age of 25.7 years and underwent appendectomy through this technique. Mean procedure duration was of 37.2 min. Regarding surgical findings, three had appendicitis in stage 1, four in stage 2 and four in stage 3. All patients improved well, without surgical complications, and did not require conversion to open surgery or conventional laparoscopy technique.<br />CONCLUSION: Appendectomy conducted through Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery is a feasible and promising technique that can be performed with conventional laparoscopic instruments.","24676296",\N,\N
"188","A comparative international study on the management of acute appendicitis between a developed country and a middle income country.","International journal of surgery (London, England)","BACKGROUND: In the past decade there has been an exponential increase in the use of Computerised Tomography (CT) imaging in the assessment of patients with acute appendicitis. The aim of this study was to compare management approaches and clinical outcomes of acute appendicitis in Sri Lanka and the United Kingdom.<br />METHODS: Data was collected prospectively from 400 patients referred to the General Surgical department with a differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis, 200 at University Kelaniya Sri Lanka (SL group), and 200 at University College London Hospital (UK group).<br />RESULTS: The groups were similar with respect to gender, but the SL group was younger. Preoperative work-up included ultrasound more commonly in SL patients, and CT more commonly in UK patients. More patients underwent appendicectomy in the SL group, however a laparoscopic approach was utilised more often in the UK group (50.5% vs. 11.9%). Post-operative complications were similarly represented in both groups, but re-admission occurred with greater frequency in the UK group (16.2% vs. 0%). Histologically confirmed appendicitis was seen in a significantly greater proportion of SL patients (93.1% vs. 79.8%). Multivariate analysis confirmed male gender, and diagnosis and treatment in Sri Lanka to be only factors significantly associated with positive appendicitis.<br />DISCUSSION: Expensive investigations such as CT do not appear to improve the diagnostic accuracy of appendicitis or prevent complications. This study suggests diagnostic and treatment algorithms in the SL hospital are more accurate and efficient in confirming appendicitis than those seen in the UK hospital under investigation.","24480238","2014",\N

The differential diagnoses of acute appendicitis obstetrics, and gynecological conditions (OB-GYNc) or nonspecific abdominal pain in young adult females with lower abdominal pain are clinically challenging. The present study aimed to validate the recently developed clinical score for the diagnosis of acute lower abdominal pain in female of reproductive age. Method. Medical records of reproductive age women (15-50 years) who were admitted for acute lower abdominal pain were collected. Validation data were obtained from patients admitted during a different period from the development data. Result. There were 302 patients in the validation cohort. For appendicitis, the score had a sensitivity of 91.9%, a specificity of 79.0%, and a positive likelihood ratio of 4.39. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive likelihood ratio in diagnosis of OB-GYNc were 73.0%, 91.6%, and 8.73, respectively. The areas under the receiver operating curves (ROC), the positive likelihood ratios, for appendicitis and OB-GYNc in the validation data were not significantly different from the development data, implying similar performances. Conclusion.

"190","Impact of the Alvarado score on the diagnosis of acute appendicitis: comparing clinical judgment, Alvarado score, and a new modified score in suspected appendicitis: a prospective, randomized clinical trial.","Surgical endoscopy","BACKGROUND: The Alvarado score is a clinical scoring system used in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. This study aimed to compare the reliability of the Alvarado score and clinical judgment and to refine the score to make it easier to use.<br />METHODS: In this prospective, randomized study, patients presenting at the authors' outpatient department with suspected appendicitis during a 1-year period were assigned in weekly alternation to either group A or group B. The group A patients were treated on the basis of their Alvarado score, and the group B patients underwent treatment based on clinical judgment. The correctness of the methods was assessed by evaluation of the final histology. Statistical comparison of the data was performed using SPSS 20.<br />RESULTS: The study investigated 269 patients (131 in group A and 138 in group B). The groups were homogeneous in terms of mean age, gender, body mass index, and American Society of Anesthesiologists score. The number of negative appendectomies was 12 (9.16%) in group A versus 5 (3.6%) in group B (p = 0.063). The clinical judgment had better specificity and sensitivity than the Alvarado score. For that reason, the specificity of the Alvarado score was refined using statistical methods, with weighting of certain clinical data and inclusion of new ones (e.g., ultrasound investigation). Consequently, the area under the curve by receiver operating characteristic analysis gradually increased, and the Alvarado score became more accurate.<br />CONCLUSION: The study findings showed clinical judgment to be more reliable in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis than the Alvarado score, but the score is a useful diagnostic aid, especially for young colleagues. The use of the new scoring system has become easier. It includes fewer criteria as well as an important and sensitive predictor: the ultrasound investigation.","24705731","2014","8"
"191","Iterative reconstruction technique with reduced volume CT dose index: diagnostic accuracy in pediatric acute appendicitis.","Pediatric radiology","BACKGROUND: Iterative reconstruction technique has been proposed as a means of reducing patient radiation dose in pediatric CT. Yet, the effect of such reductions on diagnostic accuracy has not been thoroughly evaluated.<br />OBJECTIVE: This study compares accuracy of diagnosing pediatric acute appendicitis using contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT scans performed with traditional pediatric weight-based protocols and filtered back projection reconstruction vs. a filtered back projection/iterative reconstruction technique blend with reduced volume CT dose index (CTDIvol).<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: Results of pediatric contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT scans done for pain and/or suspected appendicitis were reviewed in two groups: A, 192 scans performed with the hospital's established weight-based CT protocols and filtered back projection reconstruction; B, 194 scans performed with iterative reconstruction technique and reduced CTDIvol. Reduced CTDIvol was achieved primarily by reductions in effective tube current-time product (mAseff) and tube peak kilovoltage (kVp). CT interpretation was correlated with clinical follow-up and/or surgical pathology. CTDIvol, size-specific dose estimates (SSDE) and performance characteristics of the two CT techniques were then compared.<br />RESULTS: Between groups A and B, mean CTDIvol was reduced by 45%, and mean SSDE was reduced by 46%. Sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy were 96%, 97% and 96% in group A vs. 100%, 99% and 99% in group B.<br />CONCLUSION: Accuracy in diagnosing pediatric acute appendicitis was maintained in contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT scans that incorporated iterative reconstruction technique, despite reductions in mean CTDIvol and SSDE by nearly half as compared to the hospital's traditional weight-based protocols.","24996812","2014","7"
"192","Does computed tomography have any additional value after sonography in patients with suspected acute appendicitis?","Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine","OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the additional value of supplementary computed tomography (CT) after sonography for diagnosing acute appendicitis.<br />METHODS: Among 140 consecutive patients with suspected acute appendicitis who underwent both initial sonography and supplementary CT within 12 hours, 88 patients whose appendices could not be visualized on sonography were excluded. The remaining 52 patients (mean age, 37.3 years; range, 15-98 years) were enrolled in this study. Two radiologists retrospectively reviewed the findings of 52 sonographic and CT examinations, and the appendix of each patient was classified as normal, equivocal appendicitis, nonperforated acute appendicitis, or perforated appendicitis. Causes of right lower quadrant pain other than appendicitis were also recorded. The additional value of supplementary CT was evaluated by performing head-to-head comparisons between CT and sonographic results.<br />RESULTS: No patients with a normal appendix on sonography showed appendicitis on CT. In addition, there were no patients with a sonographic diagnosis of appendicitis who had a normal appendix on CT. Ten patients (19.2%) were determined to have additional value gained from CT. Among these 10 patients, however, the additional information from CT affected treatment modality decisions in only 5.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Initial sonography can be as effective as CT in patients with suspected acute appendicitis when the results are definite. Supplementary CT should only be performed when sonography is inconclusive.","23887949","2013","8"

The global implementation of acute care surgery services has been shown to facilitate the timeliness of acute surgery. The question is: Do acute care surgical units fit major regional centers like ours? The current study coincides with the introduction of a Surgical Assessment and Planning Unit (SAPU) at the Canberra Hospital and compares patient outcomes before vs. after the introduction of the SAPU, using acute appendicitis as the model illness.<br />METHODS: We reviewed patients presenting to the Canberra Hospital Emergency Department with a preliminary diagnosis of acute appendicitis before vs. after the introduction of an acute care surgical unit.<br />RESULTS: The subjects were 150 patients, ranging in age from 16 to 97 years. The mean time from presentation at casualty to surgical review and the surgical review itself was reduced by 19 and 26 %, respectively (p < 0.05). Time to the operating table and the percentage of after-hours operations were reduced by 8 and 40 %, respectively. There was a significant reduction in the utilization of abdominal ultrasonography after the implementation of the SAPU.<br />CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a SAPU has benefited the management of patients with acute surgical conditions.

This was a multi-center prospective observational study of adult patients presenting to the ED with isolated acute non-traumatic epigastric pain. Patients with abdominal tenderness at any site other than the epigastric region, or with a history of gall stones, cholecystectomy, gastrointestinal bleeding, chronic abdominal pain, trauma, or altered mental status were excluded. Emergency physician investigators performed point-of-care biliary ultrasound after clinical assessment. Demographic information, history, physical examination findings, laboratory results, additional diagnostic tests, and disposition data were collected. A total of 51 patients (39 women, 12 men) were enrolled. The mean age of the patients was 36.4 years Â± 13.6 (SD). All subjects had isolated epigastric tenderness. Gallstones were found in 20/51 (39%, 95% CI 26-52%) on point-of-care biliary ultrasound. Of the 20 patients who had gallstones, eight had sonographic signs of chloecystitis. The treating emergency physicians' initial evaluation did not plan to include an ultrasound in 17/20 patients with gallstones. 19/20 patients were initially given a GI cocktail by the treating emergency physicians. Point-of-care biliary ultrasound detected gall stones in more than one-third of ED patients with isolated acute non-traumatic epigastric pain. All patients presenting to the ED with non-traumatic epigastric pain should be evaluated for biliary disease with an ultrasound imaging study.

Misconceptions regarding the risks and effects of fetal radiation exposure may lead to inappropriate practice patterns. The objective of this study was to query physicians about their knowledge and use of imaging in gravid women.<br />METHODS: An anonymous survey was distributed to obstetrician-gynecologists and emergency medicine specialists regarding the risks of radiologic studies in pregnancy. Physicians were asked knowledge-based questions and were given case-based scenarios. The survey also queried physician demographics and practice patterns.<br />RESULTS: Forty-nine surveys were collected from 23 obstetrician-gynecologists and 26 emergency medicine physicians at a single academic institution. Respondents correctly answered 54% of the questions. Overall obstetrician-gynecologists (59%) performed better than emergency medicine physicians (43%). In particular, obstetrician-gynecologists were more accurate with questions concerning the risk of imaging for ectopic pregnancy, appendicitis, and pulmonary embolism. Emergency physicians were more likely to appropriately order trauma computed tomography scans.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Health care providers scored poorly regarding the safety and appropriateness of radiologic studies for pregnant women. Despite established protocols, there appears to be significant variation in patient management and physician knowledge. Although obstetrician-gynecologists performed better than emergency medicine physicians, there is a need for further education in both specialties.","24770227","2014","5"

All cases underwent appendectomy. Patients were allocated to the acute complicated appendicitis (ACA) group and the acute uncomplicated appendicitis group based on pathological reports. The Ï‡Â² test was used to check for differences between proportions. Multivariate analysis was made through the Logistic regression.<br />RESULTS: Of 742 patients, 533 were allocated to the ACA group, including acute suppurative appendicitis 306 patients, acute gangrenous appendicitis 100 patients, appendicitis with perforation 59 patients, appendicitis with abscess formation 6 patients and appendicitis with tumor 5 patients. Statistical result shows that the patients of ACA group usually had higher total WBC count, local or diffuse muscle guarding, intraluminal stercolith or periappendiceal fluid. Logistic regression also indicated that ACA were mathematically related to high level white blood cell count (>20 Ã— 10â¹/L, OR = 2.717, 95%CI: 1.834-4.027, P < 0.05), local or diffuse muscle guarding (OR = 1.649, 95%CI: 1.047-2.597, P < 0.05), intraluminal stercolith (OR = 2.939, 95%CI: 1.607-5.377, P < 0.05) and periappendiceal fluid (OR = 3.273, 95%CI: 1.424-7.525, P < 0.05).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Patients with high level WBC count, local or diffuse muscle guarding, intraluminal stercolith or periappendiceal fluid are likely suffering from acute complicated appendicitis.

Mean patient age was 40.5 (standard deviation [SD] 16.8) years, and 51.5% were female. Three hundred ninety of 409 (95.4%) believed doctors should explain the risks and benefits of CT, and 316/409 (77.3%) thought an informed consent form should be signed. One hundred seventy-nine of 409 (43.8%) patients recognized that there was more radiation from a CT scan than a single chest x-ray study. Three hundred twenty-four of 409 (79.2%) preferred CT angiography over lumbar puncture to exclude subarachnoid hemorrhage. To diagnose appendicitis, 199/409 (48.7%) preferred an ultrasound first even if it meant needing a subsequent confirmatory CT, and 193/409 (47.2%) preferred a CT right away.

Imaging findings/reports for the CT and ultrasound examinations, and clinical data/outcomes were recorded. The time interval between the CT and ultrasound examinations was calculated. Mean length of stay (LOS) was compared to that of age-matched controls who did not have subsequent ultrasound using the t-test.<br />RESULTS: Only 3% (four of 126 cases) of the pelvic ultrasound examinations showed positive findings, all of which were endometrial abnormalities. One patient was diagnosed with an endometrial polyp, whereas the others were lost to follow-up. In none of the four cases was the pelvic ultrasound finding relevant to the acute presentation or altered acute care. The average time between CT to ultrasound was 3Â h and 4Â min. Mean LOS was 22Â h and 13Â min for the cohort, and 16Â h and 8Â min for the age-matched controls, although this was not statistically significant (pÂ =Â 0.29).<br />CONCLUSION: Immediate ultrasound re-imaging of the pelvis following negative CT in women with acute abdominal/pelvic pain yields no additional diagnostic information and does not alter acute care.","23890572","2013","11"

Methods: Descriptive analysis of pregnant patients who underwent an US for acute abdominal pain over a 6-year period using data from a statewide quality improvement collaborative and a single center. Results: Statewide, 131 pregnant patients underwent an appendectomy and 85% had an US. In our single-center case series, 49 pregnant patients underwent an US for acute abdominal pain and four patients had appendicitis (8%). Of those, three were definitively diagnosed with US. The appendix was visualized by US in five patients (3 appendicitis/2 normal). Mean gestational age was 11 weeks for visualization of the appendix versus 20 weeks for non-visualization (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Concordance between US and pathology was similar statewide and at our institution (43%). Conclusions: US appears to play a central role in the evaluation of appendicitis in pregnant women, especially in the first trimester, and often contributes to definitive disposition. US performed less well in excluding appendicitis; however, in certain clinical settings, providers appeared to trust US findings. From these results, we developed a multidisciplinary imaging pathway for pregnant patients who present with acute abdominal pain concerning for appendicitis.","24913357","2014","7"

"206","Uncovering malpractice in appendectomies: a review of 234 cases.","Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract","BACKGROUND: General surgery is a \"high-risk specialty\" with respect to medical malpractice rates, and appendicitis is one of the most common diagnoses encountered by practitioners. Our objectives were to detail issues affecting malpractice litigation regarding appendicitis and appendectomies, including outcomes, awards, alleged causes of malpractice, and other factors instrumental in determining legal responsibility and increasing patient safety.<br />STUDY DESIGN: Publically available federal and state court records were examined for pertinent jury verdict and settlement reports. Information from 234 pertinent cases was collected, including alleged causes of malpractice and outcomes.<br />RESULTS: Of the 234 cases included in this study, the most common factor noted was an alleged delay in diagnosis (67.1%), followed by intraoperative negligence (16.2%). Alleged deficits in informed consent, although only specifically cited as a cause of malpractice in 1.3% of cases, were found to be an important aspect of many cases. In total, 59.8% of cases were ruled in favor of the physician, 23.7% in favor of the plaintiff, and 5.5% reached a settlement. The average plaintiff award was US $794,152, and the average settlement award was US $1,434,286.<br />CONCLUSION: An important strategy to decrease liability in a physician's practice is prompt evaluation of an appendicitis patient. An integral part of this is efficient communication between physicians practicing a wide variety of specialties, especially including practitioners in emergency medicine and general surgery. Additionally, completing a thorough informed consent explaining all aspects of the procedure including the factors we outline will not only increase patient awareness of potential risks but also protect the physician in the face of litigation.","23903929","2013","10"
"207","The need for surgery in acute abdominal pain: a randomized study of abdominal computed tomography.","In vivo (Athens, Greece)","AIM: To assess the need for surgical treatment in patients with acute abdominal pain in a prospective randomized study.<br />PATIENTS AND METHODS: Initially 203 patients with acute abdominal pain were randomized to the routine abdominal computed tomography CT (rCT, n=118), or selective abdominal CT group (sCT, n=85) over a period of 16 months. Ninety-three of the randomized patients (45.8%) underwent the study design and were reached for follow-up at three months.<br />RESULTS: Diagnostic accuracy improved significantly in the rCT group (p<0.001). The surgeon's assessment of the need for surgery changed more often in the rCT group than in the sCT group (78.7% vs. 46.9%, p=0.002). The confidence to treat operatively increased significantly in the rCT vs. the sCT group (65.6% vs. 40.6%, p=0.028). The rCT was the only independent parameter for the change of the assessment of surgery.<br />CONCLUSION: Routine CT allows for more confidence in decision making for the surgical treatment of patients with acute abdominal pain.","24815831",\N,\N

The reasons for reoperation were as follows: 13 with abdominal abscess among whom 4 complicated with internal fistula, 1 with residual toothpick, 1 with ileocecal lymphadenoma complicated with bowel obstruction, 1 with obturator hernia, 1 with intestinal vascular malformation. Twelve patients underwent laparoscopic reoperation after conservative treatments were invalid, among whom 5 completed laparoscopic operation successfully and 7 converted to laparotomy. The other 5 patients underwent emergency abdominal operation. All the patients were cured and discharged from hospital 7-21 days postoperatively.<br />CONCLUSION: The laparoscopic technique has unique advantages, but must strictly adhere to the indications of Laparoscopic exploration and strictly follow the surgical operation procedures. In the special condition,and in diagnosis and surgery difficulty,laparoscopic surgery should be timely and decisive conversion to open surgery in the diagnosis and treatment of surgical acute abdomen.","22736133","2012","6"
"209","A simple algorithm reduces computed tomography use in the diagnosis of appendicitis in children.","Surgery","BACKGROUND: A diagnostic algorithm for appendicitis in children was created to reduce computed tomography (CT) use owing to the risk of cancer from radiation exposure and cost of CT. This study evaluates the impact of the algorithm on CT use and diagnostic accuracy of appendicitis.<br />METHODS: Patients â‰¤18 years who underwent appendectomy for suspected appendicitis after presenting to the emergency department for 2 years before and 3 years after algorithm implementation were identified. Clinical characteristics and outcomes, including use of CT and negative appendectomy rate, were compared between the pre- and post-implementation periods. Multivariable analysis was used to determine the impact of CT on negative appendectomy.<br />RESULTS: We identified 331 patients-41% in the pre- and 59% in the post-implementation period. CT utilization decreased from 39% to 18% (P < .001) after implementation. The negative appendectomy rate increased from 9% to 11% (P = .59). Use of CT did not impact the risk of negative appendectomy (P = .64).<br />CONCLUSION: Utilization of CT was significantly reduced after implementation of a diagnostic algorithm for appendicitis without impacting diagnostic accuracy. Given the concern for increased risk of cancer after CT, these results support use of an algorithm in children with suspected appendicitis.","24953265","2014","8"
"210","Computed tomography in acute abdominal pain: an overused investigation?","ANZ journal of surgery","BACKGROUND: The use of computed tomography (CT) for the evaluation of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute abdominal pain has increased. We set out to investigate its effectiveness.<br />METHODS: A prospective study conducted at a tertiary referral centre between August and September 2012, utilizing a questionnaire completed by the ordering doctors. Patients with acute abdominal pain who underwent an abdominal CT scan were included in the study, excluding those with a history of recent abdominal trauma or abdominal, pelvic, groin or scrotal surgery.<br />RESULTS: Of the 260 patients undergoing an abdominal CT scan for the investigation of acute abdominal pain, 60 had questionnaires completed. Fifty-seven per cent of abdominal CT scans were ordered by an ED registrar or consultant. Sixty-five per cent of patients were not discussed with the surgical team prior to ED staff ordering the CT scan. 'To confirm clinical suspicion' and 'to rule out sinister aetiology' were the most important reasons for ordering an abdominal CT. In 54% of cases, there was a change in primary diagnosis post CT scan and in 50% of patients, a change in disposition. Diagnostic confidence in the primary diagnosis did not change significantly post-CT scan. There was no significant difference between which group ordered a CT scan and the probability that the scan showed nil acute pathology.<br />DISCUSSION: Abdominal CT scans frequently changed the clinical diagnosis and patient disposition. Twenty-three per cent of patients had no identifiable cause on CT scan for their acute abdominal pain.","23937360","2014","3"
"211","Inflammatory appendix mass in patients with acute appendicitis: CT diagnosis and clinical relevance.","Emergency radiology","The purpose of our study was to analyze the clinical relevance of computerized tomography (CT) in providing the diagnosis of inflammatory appendix mass (IAM) in patients with acute appendicitis. The CT images of 134 patients were reviewed. Two groups of patients were made according to the presence (group 1; nâ€‰=â€‰21) or the absence (group 2; nâ€‰=â€‰113) of IAM. Clinical signs of patients, CT features, complications at surgery, and histological examinations were noted. Inter-observer agreement was assessed by using kappa statistics. Twenty-one patients presenting with CT features of IAM were diagnosed. An excellent inter-observer agreement (Îºâ€‰=â€‰0.94) was assessed for the diagnosis of IAM. No significant statistical difference in the age distribution was observed between patients with IAM (mean age 55) and patients without (mean age 45) (pâ€‰=â€‰0.2232). No clinical sign showed a statistically significant association with the presence of IAM (pâ€‰=â€‰0.707) or with complication encountered at surgery (pâ€‰=â€‰0.180). Delay to CT examination was 5.4Â days in patients presenting with CT features of IAM and of 1.7Â days for patients presenting without (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0001). Conversely to acute appendicitis complicated by simple perforation (pâ€‰=â€‰0.153) or peri-appendicular abscess (pâ€‰=â€‰0.501), acute appendicitis presenting with IAM showed a statistically significant association with complications encountered at surgery (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0003) and the need for conversion to open surgery (pâ€‰=â€‰0.001). Performing CT in complicated acute appendicitis provides the diagnosis of IAM. Distinction of IAM appeared to be of clinical relevance, since immediate surgery in IAM was statistically associated with surgical complications and conversion to open surgery in our study.","25038932","2014","7"
"212","The effect of race on outcomes for appendicitis in children: a nationwide analysis.","American journal of surgery","BACKGROUND: We sought to examine the impact of race on the management and outcomes of appendicitis in children aged 20 years or younger.<br />METHODS: We studied 96,865 inpatient admissions for children undergoing an appendectomy for acute appendicitis in 2009 using the Kids' Inpatient Database.<br />RESULTS: Perforation at presentation was more common among African-Americans and Hispanics than Caucasians (27.5% and 32.5%, respectively, vs 23.9%, PÂ <Â .001). African-Americans were less likely to have a laparoscopic procedure (odds ratio [OR]: .839, PÂ <Â .001) and more likely to experience a complication (OR: 1.753, PÂ <Â .001). Hispanics were also more likely to have a complication (OR: 1.123, PÂ =Â .001). African-Americans and Hispanics remained in the hospital for .73 more days than Caucasians (3.07 vs 2.34Â days, PÂ <Â .001).<br />CONCLUSIONS: African-American and Hispanic children present more often with perforation. Adjusting for perforation, they were more likely to have a complication and longer hospital stays. Access to care and delayed presentations may be potential explanations.","24791639","2014","5"

Part A","BACKGROUND: Although cosmetic superiority is widely stated as an advantage of single-incision laparoscopy, there are limited studies looking at cosmetic outcome. We sought to determine patients' cosmetic satisfaction after undergoing appendectomy by the single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy (SILA), multiport laparoscopic appendectomy (LA), or open appendectomy (OA) procedure.<br />PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five hundred eighty pediatric patients who underwent appendectomy at a single institution between February 2010 and July 2011 were identified and asked to complete the Patient Scar Assessment Scale (PSAS), a validated evaluation tool for linear scars. In addition, patients were asked the \"Ultimate Question\" (UQ), which correlates with a patient's overall satisfaction. Linear regression models were used to examine differences between surgical approaches with statistical significance set at P<.05. Covariates for all models included patient demographics, length of stay, and surgeon.<br />RESULTS: In total, 212 surveys were returned (SILA, 122; LA, 41; OA, 49) for a response rate of 37%. Regression models demonstrated significantly higher mean total PSAS scores for patients who underwent SILA and laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) appendectomy procedures compared with the open procedure (SILA, 8.70; LA, 8.86; OA, 8.01; Î²=-0.21, P<.05). Patients who experienced the SILA and LA procedures reported significantly higher mean UQ scores compared with OA (SILA, 9.79; LA, 9.75; OA, 9.39; Î²=-0.22, P<.05). SILA patients reported a 10 on the UQ significantly more often (91.1%) compared with either LA (81%) or OA (75.5%) (P<.05).<br />CONCLUSIONS: SILA or LA appendectomy was associated with significantly increased cosmetic satisfaction by patients and their families when compared with OA. This is the first study to show that pediatric patients value attempts to minimize scarring with laparoscopic surgery. Further studies are needed to determine if specific patient factors influence satisfaction with scars.","25062342","2014","8"

"217","Does selective use of computed tomography scan reduce the rate of \"white\" (negative) appendectomy?","The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ","BACKGROUND: Appendectomies are the most common operations performed on an emergency basis. The accepted rate of \"white\" appendectomies is around 20%. In recent years, computed tomography (CT) scanning has been recognized as a valuable tool with high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The use of CT scans in the management of patients with suspected acute appendicitis is increasing worldwide.<br />OBJECTIVES: To assess whether introducing more liberal use of CT in the management of patients presenting to the emergency room with right lower quadrant pain or suspected acute appendicitis would reduce the rate of \"white\" appendectomies.<br />METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of the pathology reports and CT scans of all patients who underwent appendectomy during a 3 year period. We examined the correlation between the rate of CT scans performed and the rate of \"white\" appendectomies.<br />RESULTS: Overall, we performed 797 appendectomies during the study period. In 2004, we performed 272 appendectomies and CT in 34 patients (12.5%). In 2005, we performed 275 appendectomies and CT in 83 patients (30.2%). In 2006, we performed 250 appendectomies and CT in 88 patients (35.2%). The percentage of \"white\" appendectomies decreased from 29% in 2004 to 21.1% in 2005 and to 18.8% in 2006.<br />CONCLUSIONS: It appears that a more selective use of CT scans in the management of suspected appendicitis could reduce the rate of \"white\" appendectomies.","25058992","2014","6"
"218","The normal appendix on CT: does size matter?","PloS one","PURPOSE: (1) To evaluate the frequency of visualisation and measurements of the normal appendix. (2) To correlate Body Mass Index (BMI) and gender with visualisation of the normal appendix. (3) To correlate age, gender and body length with appendiceal length.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 186 patients undergoing abdominal CT without suspicion of acute appendicitis was done. Frequency of visualisation and measurements (including maximal outer diameter, wall thickness, length, content, location of base and tip) of normal appendices were recorded.<br />RESULTS: Prevalence of appendectomy was 34.4%. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of visualisation of the normal appendix were 76%, 94%, 96%, 67%, and 82% respectively. The mean maximal diameter of the appendix was 8.19 mmÂ±1.6 (SD) (range, 4.2-12.8 mm). The mean length of the appendix was 81.11 mmÂ±28.44 (SD) (range, 7.2-158.8 mm). The mean wall thickness of the appendix was 2.22 mmÂ±0.56 (SD) (range, 1.15-3.85 mm). The most common location of the appendiceal tip was pelvic in 66% appendices. The most common location of the appendiceal base was inferior, medial, and posterior in 37%. The normal appendix contained high-density material in 2.2%. There was a significant correlation between gender and appendiceal length, with men having longer appendices than women.<br />CONCLUSION: Most normal appendices are seen at multislice CT using i.v. contrast. The maximal outer diameter of the normal appendix overlaps with values currently used to diagnose appendicitis on CT.","24802879","2014",\N
"219","Outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy should be the standard of care for uncomplicated appendicitis.","The journal of trauma and acute care surgery","BACKGROUND: In 2012, a protocol for routine outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis was published reflecting high success, low morbidity, and significant cost savings. Despite this, national data reflect that the majority of laparoscopic appendectomies are performed with overnight admission. This study updates our experience with outpatient appendectomy since our initial report, confirming the efficacy of this approach.<br />METHODS: In July 2010, a prospective protocol for outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy was adopted at our institution. Patients were dismissed from the postanesthesia recovery room or day surgery if they met predefined criteria for dismissal. Patients admitted to a hospital room as either full admission or observation status were considered failures of outpatient management. An institutional review board-approved retrospective review of patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis from July 2010 through December 2012 was performed to analyze success of outpatient management, postoperative morbidity and mortality, as well as readmission rates.<br />RESULTS: Three hundred forty-five patients underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis during this time frame. There were 166 men and 179 women, with a mean age of 35 years. Three hundred five patients were managed as outpatients, with a success rate of 88%. Forty patients (12%) were admitted for preexisting comorbidities (15 patients), postoperative morbidity (6 patients), or lack of transportation or home support (19 patients). Twenty-three patients (6.6%) experienced postoperative morbidity. There were no mortalities. Four patients (1%) were readmitted for transient fever, nausea/vomiting, partial small bowel obstruction, and deep venous thrombosis.<br />CONCLUSION: Outpatient laparoscopic appendectomy can be performed with a high rate of success, a low morbidity, and a low readmission rate.

"220","When does ultrasonography influence management in suspected appendicitis?","ANZ journal of surgery","BACKGROUND: Accurate diagnosis of appendicitis is challenging, particularly in children. Moreover, opinion is divided over the role of ultrasonography (US) in its diagnosis and how US may influence management. This study compares the use of US in two tertiary paediatric hospitals and how it influenced the management of suspected appendicitis.<br />METHODS: Data from acute admissions, radiology, histopathology and theatre were cross-referenced to review all children who underwent an appendicectomy (with or without preoperative US) for suspected appendicitis in Christchurch (CH) in New Zealand and Aberdeen (AB) in Scotland in 2009.<br />RESULTS: Five hundred and ninety-nine patients (442 CH; 157 AB) were included, with similar age and gender distributions. US was performed in 23% of patients with an overall appendix visualization rate of 29%. The overall positive and negative predictive values were 67% and 100%, respectively. Females were more likely to have US than males (P < 0.001, Ï‡(2) ). In females with no appendix seen on US, in the presence or absence of other pathology, a normal appendix was confirmed in 50% and 58%, respectively. Visualizing the appendix resulted in a lower rate of normal appendix at operation (20%, 4/20) compared with when the appendix was not visualized (56%, 14/25).<br />CONCLUSION: Identification of a normal appendix on US seems sufficiently accurate to exclude appendicitis with confidence, while positive US should be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical features in influencing the decision to operate. The incidence of a non-inflamed appendix at operation could be reduced with an increased rate of appendiceal visualization by sonographers.","24405944","2014","5"

We developed an automated system to extract relevant elements from ED physician notes and lab values and to automatically assign a risk category for acute appendicitis (high, equivocal, or low), based on the Pediatric Appendicitis Score. We evaluated the performance of the system against a manually created gold standard (chart reviews by ED physicians) for recall, specificity, and precision.<br />RESULTS: The system achieved an average F-measure of 0.867 (0.869 recall and 0.863 precision) for risk classification, which was comparable to physician experts. Recall/precision were 0.897/0.952 in the low-risk category, 0.855/0.886 in the high-risk category, and 0.854/0.766 in the equivocal-risk category. The information that the system required as input to achieve high F-measure was available within the first 4 h of the ED visit.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Automated appendicitis risk categorization based on EHR content, including information from clinical notes, shows comparable performance to physician chart reviewers as measured by their inter-annotator agreement and represents a promising new approach for computerized decision support to promote application of evidence-based medicine at the point of care.","24130231","2013","12"

Many adolescents and young adults are exposed to the associated radiation. A recent single-institution trial has reported promising results for low-dose computed tomography; however, this technique has not yet been widely adopted. LOCAT (low-dose computed tomography for appendicitis trial), a multi-institution randomized controlled non-inferiority trial, aims to compare low-dose computed tomography and standard-dose computed tomography as the first-line imaging tests for adolescents and young adults, and therefore to test the generalizability of the previous single-institution trial results.<br />METHODS/DESIGN: Participants with suspected appendicitis are randomly assigned to either the low-dose group (with a typical effective dose of 2Â mSv) or the standard-dose group (as used in normal practice at each participating site, typically 8Â mSv). The primary end point is the negative appendectomy rate (the percentage of the number of uninflamed appendices that were removed among all non-incidental appendectomies), which is a consequence of false-positive diagnoses, with a non-inferiority margin of 4.5 percentage points. The key secondary end point is the appendiceal perforation rate, which is a consequence of delayed (or false-negative) diagnoses. Participant recruitment will be continued until the number of non-incidental appendectomies for each group exceeds 444. The total number of expected participants approximates 3,000, including those not undergoing appendectomy.<br />DISCUSSION: In addition to the study protocol, we elaborate on several challenging or potentially debatable components of the study design, including the broad eligibility criteria, choice of the primary end point, potential effect of using advanced imaging techniques on study results, determining and adjusting the radiation doses, ambiguities in reference standards, rationale for the non-inferiority margin, use of the intention-to-treat approach and difficulties in defining adverse events.<br />TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01925014.","24438500","2014",\N

It was also aimed to show the relationship of RDW with leukocyte count and C-reactive protein (CRP) level.<br />METHODS: This study was conducted via retrospective assessment of the hospital records of the adult patients who were operated for acute appendicitis between January 2010 and February 2013 and had a pathology report that confirmed the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The patients in the control group were selected from healthy adults of similar age who applied to check-up clinic. Age, gender, leukocyte count, CRP, and RDW values were recorded. This study is a case controlled retrospective clinical study.<br />RESULTS: A total of 590 patients in the acute appendicitis group and 121 patients in the control group were included, making up a total of 711 subjects. The mean RDW levels were 15.4â€‰Â±â€‰1.5% in the acute appendicitis group, while 15.9â€‰Â±â€‰1.4% in the control group. CRP, leukocyte count were significantly higher in the acute appendicitis group, and RDW level were significantly lower in the acute appendicitis group (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001, pâ€‰=â€‰0.001, respectively).

However, we found a correlation between CRP and leukocyte levels.<br />CONCLUSION: RDW level was lower in patients with acute appendicitis. The magnitude of difference in RDW seen between acute appendicitis and controls was so slight as to be of no utility in diagnostic testing.","24216220","2013",\N

"229","Outcomes of children with suspected appendicitis and incompletely visualized appendix on ultrasound.","Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine","OBJECTIVES: The objective was to review the clinical outcomes of children with suspected appendicitis after an ultrasound (US) examination fails to fully visualize the appendix, the diagnostic characteristics of US in children with suspected appendicitis, and the predictive value of secondary signs of appendicitis when the appendix is not fully visualized.<br />METHODS: This was a retrospective health record review of children aged 3 to 17 years presenting to a tertiary pediatric emergency department (ED) with suspected appendicitis. Descriptive statistics and diagnostic test characteristics are reported.<br />RESULTS: Overall, 968 children had US. The appendix was fully visualized in 442 cases (45.7%), and 526 (54.3%) children had incompletely visualized appendices. The disposition of those with incompletely visualized appendices were as follows: 59.1% were discharged home, 10.5% went directly to the operating room, and 30.4% were admitted to the hospital for further observation. Of those discharged home based on clinical findings after incompletely visualized appendices, fewer than 0.3% ended up having appendicitis. Ultimately 15.6% of children with incompletely visualized appendices had pathology-confirmed appendicitis. The sensitivity and specificity of US for children with fully visualized appendices were 99.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 96.7% to 100%) and 81.3% (95% CI = 75.2% to 86.2%), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for the presence of any secondary sign in diagnosing appendicitis were 40.2% (95% CI = 29.6% to 51.7%) and 90.6% (95% CI = 87.5% to 93.2%), respectively.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Children with incompletely visualized appendices on US can be safely discharged home based on clinical findings with an acceptable rate of missed appendicitis. Children with nonreassuring clinical examinations following incompletely visualized appendices on US may benefit from further imaging studies prior to appendectomy, to reduce the rate of negative appendectomy. While the presence of secondary signs of inflammation can be used to rule in appendicitis, statistical strength to rule out appendicitis in the absence of secondary signs is insufficient.","24842505","2014","5"
"230","Enteral contrast in the computed tomography diagnosis of appendicitis: comparative effectiveness in a prospective surgical cohort.","Annals of surgery","OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to perform a comparative effectiveness study of intravenous (IV)-only versus IV + enteral contrast in computed tomographic (CT) scans performed for patients undergoing appendectomy across a diverse group of hospitals.<br />BACKGROUND: Small randomized trials from tertiary centers suggest that enteral contrast does not improve diagnostic performance of CT for suspected appendicitis, but generalizability has not been demonstrated. Eliminating enteral contrast may improve efficiency, patient comfort, and safety.<br />METHODS: We analyzed data for adult patients who underwent nonelective appendectomy at 56 hospitals over a 2-year period. Data were obtained directly from patient charts by trained abstractors. Multivariate logistic regression was utilized to adjust for potential confounding. The main outcome measure was concordance between final radiology interpretation and final pathology report.<br />RESULTS: A total of 9047 adults underwent appendectomy and 8089 (89.4%) underwent CT, 54.1% of these with IV contrast only and 28.5% with IV + enteral contrast. Pathology findings correlated with radiographic findings in 90.0% of patients who received IV + enteral contrast and 90.4% of patients scanned with IV contrast alone. Hospitals were categorized as rural or urban and by their teaching status. Regardless of hospital type, there was no difference in concordance between IV-only and IV + enteral contrast. After adjusting for age, sex, comorbid conditions, weight, hospital type, and perforation, odds ratio of concordance for IV + enteral contrast versus IV contrast alone was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.72-1.25).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Enteral contrast does not improve CT evaluation of appendicitis in patients undergoing appendectomy. These broadly generalizable results from a diverse group of hospitals suggest that enteral contrast can be eliminated in CT scans for suspected appendicitis.","24598250","2014","8"

"232","Emergency department experience with nonoral contrast computed tomography in the evaluation of patients for appendicitis.","Journal of patient safety","STUDY OBJECTIVES: The American College of Radiology lists oral contrast as an institution-specific option in the evaluation of right lower quadrant pain. Previous literature indicates that an accurate assessment for appendicitis can be made by CT using IV contrast alone, with significant time savings from withholding oral contrast. Before 2010, the protocol for CT use in the evaluation of possible appendicitis or undifferentiated abdominal pain routinely included oral contrast. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of repeat CT scans with oral contrast for the purpose of arriving at a final disposition in patients undergoing evaluation for abdominal pain. This analysis was also to determine if the general surgery service was willing and able to make accurate clinical determinations to operate without the use of oral contrast.<br />METHODS: Consecutive abdominal CTs for nontraumatic abdominal pain were evaluated retrospectively over a 7-month period from January through July 2010. CT scans performed for evaluation of trauma were eliminated, as were cases in patients with known previous appendectomy or in cases in which appendicitis was not a consideration. Follow-up was by chart review over the ensuing 30 days for complications or need for surgery, which was not detected after the initial CT scan. The study was conducted at a teaching hospital, level I trauma center with an annual ED census of 99,000 visits.<br />RESULTS: A total of 311 CT scans met the study criteria. No cases of appendicitis were missed. Two patients were operated on based upon inflammatory findings in the right lower quadrant, one with typhlitis, the second with possible inflammatory bowel disease versus typhlitis. In each case, the diagnosis was made by CT, but the surgery service chose to operate based on clinical findings. Sixteen (5.14%; 95% CI, 3.2%-8.2%) cases of acute appendicitis were accurately identified. A normal appendix was visualized in 125 (40.2 %; 95% CI, 34.9-45.7) patients. No patients (0%; 95% CI, 0%-1.2%) required a repeat CT scan with oral contrast as part of the workup. On 30-day follow-up by chart review, no (0%; 95% CI, 0%-1.2%) significant surgical problems were identified, and no cases of missed appendicitis were identified.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal CT scan without the use of oral contrast is accurate to allow for appropriate decision making by emergency physicians and general surgeons. In our series, no patients required repeat scanning. Further assessment by larger studies is appropriate.","24080721","2014","9"
"233","Complicated appendicitis: analysis of risk factors in children.","African journal of paediatric surgery : AJPS","BACKGROUND: Acute appendicitis (AA) is the most common surgical emergency in childhood. The risk of rupture is negligible within the first 24 h, climbing to 6% after 36 h from the onset of symptoms. Because of difficulty in accurate diagnosis of AA a significant number of children still are being managed when it is already perforated. There is always a need to make an early diagnosis of AA and to find out the risk factors associated with development of complication in this condition.<br />PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 102 patients with a clinical diagnosis of AA were admitted during the study period. On admission, a good clinical history and proper physical examination was performed. All the eligible patients who finally diagnosed clinically as having AA were planned for emergency open appendectomy. The removed appendix was sent for histopathological examination in all the study subjects.<br />RESULTS: Out of 102 cases, 93 cases were histopathologically appendicitis, rest nine cases showed no evidence of inflammation so the rate of negative appendectomy was around 9%. On histopathology normal appendix was found in nine patients (8.9%), AA in 71 patients (69.6%), complicated appendicitis (CA) which includes perforated and gangrenous appendicitis was present in 22 patients (21.5%). Perforations were more common in patients who were younger than 5 years. >60% patients presented with CA when the duration of pain was >72 h. Presence of appendicolith increased the probability of CA.","24841008",\N,\N
"234","Acute appendicitis in the elderly: risk factors for perforation.","World journal of emergency surgery : WJES","BACKGROUND: Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency and becomes serious when it perforates. Perforation is more frequent in the elderly patients. The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors of perforation in elderly patients who presented with acute appendicitis.<br />METHODOLOGY: The medical records of 214 patients over the age of 60 years who had a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of acute appendicitis over a period of 10 years (2003-2013) were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were grouped into those with perforated and those with nonperforated appendicitis. Comparison was made between both groups in regard to demography, clinical presentation, and time delay to surgery, diagnosis, hospital stay and postoperative complications. Clinical assessment, Ultrasonography and Computerized tomography, in that order, were used for diagnosis. The incidence of perforation was also compared with a previous report from the same region 10 years earlier.<br />RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 214 patients over the age of 60 years had acute appendicitis, 103 males and 111 females. Appendix was found perforated in 87 (41%) patients, 46 (53%) males and 41 (47%) females. Of all patients, 31% were diagnosed by clinical assessment alone, 40% needed US and 29% CT scan. Of all the risk factors studied, the patient's pre-hospital time delay was the most important risk factor for perforation. Perforation rate was not dependent on the presence of comorbid diseases or in-hospital time delay. Post operative complications occurred in 44 (21%) patients and they were three times more common in the perforated group, 33 (75%) patients in the perforated and 11 (25%) in the nonperforated group. There were 6 deaths (3%), 4 in the perforated and 2 in the nonperforated group.<br />CONCLUSION: Acute appendicitis in elderly patients is a serious disease that requires early diagnosis and treatment. Appendiceal Perforation increases both mortality and morbidity. All elderly patients presented to the hospital with abdominal pain should be admitted and investigated. The early use of CT scan can cut short the way to the appropriate treatment.","24428909","2014",\N

This study compared outcomes after open and laparoscopic appendicectomy in a national, population-based cohort.<br />METHODS: All patients who underwent open or intended laparoscopic appendicectomy in Sweden between 1992 and 2008 were identified from the Swedish National Patient Register. The outcomes were analysed according to intention to treat with multivariable adjustment for confounding factors and survival analytical techniques where appropriate.<br />RESULTS: A total of 169â€‰896 patients underwent open (136â€‰754) or intended laparoscopic (33â€‰142) appendicectomy. The rate of intended laparoscopic appendicectomy increased from 3Â·8 per cent (425 of 11â€‰175) in 1992 to 32Â·9 per cent (3066 of 9329) in 2008. Laparoscopy was used most frequently in middle-aged patients, women and patients with no co-morbidity. The rate of conversion from laparoscopy to open appendicectomy decreased from 75Â·3 per cent (320 of 425) in 1992 to 19Â·7 per cent (603 of 3066) in 2008. Conversion was more frequent in women and those with perforated appendicitis, and the rate increased with age and increasing co-morbidity. After adjustment for co-variables, compared with open appendicectomy, laparoscopy was associated with a shorter length of hospital stay (by 0Â·06â€‰days), a lower frequency of negative appendicectomy (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0Â·59; Pâ€‰<â€‰0Â·001), wound infection (adjusted OR 0Â·54; Pâ€‰=â€‰0Â·004) and wound rupture (adjusted OR 0Â·44; Pâ€‰=â€‰0Â·010), but higher rates of intestinal injury (adjusted OR 1Â·32; Pâ€‰=â€‰0Â·042), readmission (adjusted OR 1Â·10; Pâ€‰<â€‰0Â·001), postoperative abdominal abscess (adjusted OR 1Â·58; Pâ€‰<â€‰0Â·001) and urinary infection (adjusted OR 1Â·39; Pâ€‰=â€‰0Â·020). Laparoscopy had a lower risk of postoperative small bowel obstruction during the first 2â€‰years after surgery, but not thereafter.<br />CONCLUSION: The outcomes of laparoscopic and open appendicectomy showed a complex and contrasting pattern and small differences of limited clinical importance. The choice of surgical method therefore depends on the local situation, the surgeon's experience and the patient's preference.","24979720","2014","8"
"237","Extra-appendiceal findings in pediatric abdominal CT for suspected appendicitis.","Pediatric radiology","BACKGROUND: Much has been written regarding the incidence, types, importance and management of abdominal CT incidental findings in adults, but there is a paucity of literature on incidental findings in children.<br />OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the prevalence and characteristics of extra-appendiceal and incidental findings in pediatric abdominal CT performed for suspected appendicitis.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of abdominal CT for suspected appendicitis in a pediatric emergency department from July 2010 to June 2012. Extra-appendiceal findings were recorded. Any subsequent imaging was noted. Extra-appendiceal findings were divided into incidental findings of doubtful clinical significance, alternative diagnostic findings potentially providing a diagnosis other than appendicitis explaining the symptoms, and incidental findings that were abnormalities requiring clinical correlation and sometimes requiring further evaluation but not likely related to the patient symptoms.<br />RESULTS: One hundred sixty-five children had abdominal CT for suspected appendicitis. Seventy-seven extra-appendiceal findings were found in 57 (34.5%) patients. Most findings (64 of 77) were discovered in children who did not have appendicitis. Forty-one of these findings (53%) could potentially help explain the patient's symptoms, while 30 of the findings (39%) were abnormalities that were unlikely to be related to the symptoms but required clinical correlation and sometimes further work-up. Six of the findings (8%) had doubtful or no clinical significance.<br />CONCLUSION: Extra-appendiceal findings are common in children who undergo abdominal CT in the setting of suspected appendicitis. A significant percentage of these patients have findings that help explain their symptoms. Knowledge of the types and prevalence of these findings may help radiologists in the planning and interpretation of CT examinations in this patient population.","24595877","2014","7"
"238","Acute abdominal pain in patients with lassa fever: Radiological assessment and diagnostic challenges.","Nigerian medical journal : journal of the Nigeria Medical Association","BACKGROUND: To highlight the problems of diagnosis and management of acute abdomen in patients with lassa fever. And to also highlight the need for high index of suspicion of lassa fever in patients presenting with acute abdominal pain in order to avoid surgical intervention with unfavourable prognosis and nosocomial transmission of infections, especially in Lassa fever-endemic regions.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of experiences of the authors in the management of lassa fever over a 4-year period (2004-2008). Literature on lassa fever, available in the internet and other local sources, was studied in November 2010 and reviewed.<br />RESULTS: Normal plain chest radiographic picture can change rapidly due to pulmonary oedema, pulmonary haemorrhage and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Plain abdominal radiograph may show dilated bowels with signs of paralytic ileus or dynamic intestinal obstruction due to bowel wall haemorrhage or inflamed and enlarged Peyer's patches. Ultrasound may show free intra-peritoneal fluid due to peritonitis and intra-peritoneal haemorrhage. Bleeding into the gall bladder wall may erroneously suggest infective cholecystitis. Pericardial effusion with or without pericarditis causing abdominal pain may be seen using echocardiography. High index of suspicion, antibody testing for lassa fever and viral isolation in a reference laboratory are critical for accurate diagnosis.<br />CONCLUSION: Patients from lassa fever-endemic regions may present with features that suggest acute abdomen. Radiological studies may show findings that suggest acute abdomen but these should be interpreted in the light of the general clinical condition of the patient. It is necessary to know that acute abdominal pain and vomiting in lassa fever-endemic areas could be caused by lassa fever, which is a medical condition. Surgical option should be undertaken with restraint as it increases the morbidity, may worsen the prognosis and increase the risk of nosocomial transmission.","25013248","2014","5"

"241","Cost and radiation savings of partial substitution of ultrasound for CT in appendicitis evaluation: a national projection.","AJR. American journal of roentgenology","OBJECTIVE: The costs of an ultrasound-CT protocol and a CT-only protocol for an appendicitis evaluation are compared. For the ultrasound-CT protocol, patients with right lower quadrant abdominal pain undergo an ultrasound examination. If it is positive for appendicitis, they are sent directly to surgery, avoiding CT.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comparative effectiveness research study was conducted. The costs of imaging tests, excess surgeries, and excess surgical deaths for the ultrasound-CT protocol and the costs of imaging tests and excess cancer deaths in the CT-only protocol were estimated. Data sources were Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) datasets, national hospital discharge surveys, radiology information system cases, and U.S. Census Bureau life tables. A meta-analysis and sensitivity analyses were also conducted.<br />RESULTS: The meta-analysis showed a positive predictive value of 92.5% for CT and 91.0% for ultrasound. Analysis of CMS files showed that utilization of CT was almost exactly 2.0 examinations (one abdominal and one pelvic) per patient and for ultrasound was almost nil. The cost of this imaging protocol was $547 per patient, whereas the cost of a limited ultrasound study would be $88 per patient. For the total U.S. population, the cost savings in imaging minus the cost of extra surgeries and extra surgical deaths is $24.9 million per year. Following model VII proposed by the Committee on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR), which is known as \"BEIR VII,\" the avoidance of a 12.4-mSv exposure for 262,500 persons would prevent 180 excess cancer deaths. The value of the years of life lost would be $339.5 million. The sensitivity analyses indicate that the cost savings are robust.<br />CONCLUSION: An ultrasound-CT protocol for appendicitis evaluation offers potentially large savings over the standard CT-only protocol. There are moderate savings from using a less expensive imaging technique despite extra surgeries and large savings from radiation exposure avoided.","24370137","2014","1"

All underwent abdominal ultrasound and MRI within 2 h, with the reader blinded to other imaging findings. An expert panel established the final diagnosis after 3 months. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of three imaging strategies: ultrasound only, conditional MRI after negative or inconclusive ultrasound, and MRI only. Significance between sensitivity and specificity was calculated using McNemar's test statistic.<br />RESULTS: Between April and December 2009 we included 104 consecutive children (47 male, mean age 12). According to the expert panel, 58 patients had appendicitis. The sensitivity of MRI only and conditional MRI was 100% (95% confidence interval 92-100), that of ultrasound was significantly lower (76%; 63-85, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001).

"244","Acute appendicitis: investigating an optimal outer appendiceal diameter cut-point in a pediatric population.","The Journal of emergency medicine","BACKGROUND: Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of abdominal pain in children requiring operative intervention. Among a number of sonographic criteria to aid in the diagnosis of appendicitis, an outer diameter >6 mm is the most objective and widely accepted. However, there is a lack of evidence-based standards governing this consensus.<br />STUDY OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the outer appendiceal diameter that maximizes sensitivity and specificity in a pediatric population.<br />METHODS: A retrospective review of all urgent diagnostic ultrasounds (US) was performed over 2 years in children aged <18 years. The diagnostic accuracy of various cut-points was assessed by calculating the sensitivity and specificity and plotting a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.<br />RESULTS: The study sample consisted of 398 patients in whom the appendix was visualized on US. The median outer appendiceal diameter was significantly higher in the surgical group compared to the nonsurgical group (9.4 mm; range = 8.1-12.0 vs. 5.5 mm; range = 4.4-6.5, p < 0.01). The optimal cut-point with the greatest area under the ROC curve was determined to be an outer appendiceal diameter of 7.0 mm.<br />CONCLUSIONS: In our patients, adopting a 7-mm rather than a 6-mm appendiceal diameter threshold would balance a greater number of missed cases of acute appendicitis for a reduction in the number of unnecessary surgeries.","24113477","2014","2"

This study was conducted to characterize clinicopathological features and to investigate its association with appendiceal neoplasms. Methods. We searched the records of the Department of Pathology at Farwaniya Hospital for cases of diverticular disease of the appendix between 2003 and 2011. Histological slides and patient charts were reviewed for relevant information. Consecutive cases of acute appendicitis were selected as a control group. Results. We identified 25 cases of DDA, 24 of which occurred in men. Mean age of DDA patients was 35 Â± 10.1 years and was significantly greater than that of appendicitis patients (P = 0.027). The mean temperature of cases (37.9Â°) was significantly higher (P = 0.012) than that of the controls (37.3Â°). The cases had lower white blood cell (WBC) counts compared to controls (13.6 versus 16.7, P = 0.04). Pathological diagnosis identified 4 cases of diverticulosis, 5 cases of diverticulitis, 6 cases of diverticulosis with acute appendicitis, and 10 cases of diverticulitis and appendicitis. None of the cases was associated with any type of neoplasm. Conclusions. DDA is a rare disease, and clinicians and radiologists should be aware of it. Male sex and adult age seem to be risk factors associated with DDA. The disease may not have any direct association with any neoplasm.","24224113","2013",\N
"250","The role of mean platelet volume in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis: a retrospective case-controlled study.","Iranian Red Crescent medical journal","BACKGROUND: The level of platelet volume (MPV) has been reported to be a laboratory marker in inflammatory cases.<br />OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to seek whether MPV has a role in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. It was also aimed to show the relationship of MPV with leukocyte count and C-reactive protein (CRP) level.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted via retrospective assessment of the hospital records of the adult patients who were operated for acute appendicitis between January 2010 and December 2012 and had a pathology report that confirmed the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The patients in the control group were selected from healthy adults of similar age who applied to check-up clinic. The number of essential cases was defined by performing power analysis. Age, gender, leukocyte count, CRP, and MPV values were recorded. This study is a case controlled retrospective clinical study.<br />RESULTS: A total of 503 patients in the acute appendicitis group and 121 patients in the control group were included, making up a total of 624 subjects. The median MPV levels were 7.92 Â± 1.68 fL in the acute appendicitis group, while 7.43 Â± 1.34 fL in the control group. CRP, leukocyte count, and MPV level were significantly higher in the acute appendicitis group (P < 0.001). MPV, leukocyte count, and CRP had a sensitivity and specificity of 66% and 51%; 91% and 74%; and 97% and 41%, respectively. No correlation was found between MPV, CRP, and leukocyte count.<br />CONCLUSIONS: MPV level was higher in patients with acute appendicitis. MPV may guide the diagnostic process of acute appendicitis. However, we detected that the sensitivity and specificity of leukocyte count and CRP were superior to those of MPV in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.","24693387","2013","12"

"253","MRI features associated with acute appendicitis.","European radiology","OBJECTIVES: To identify MRI features associated with appendicitis.<br />METHODS: Features expected to be associated with appendicitis were recorded in consensus by two expert radiologists on 223 abdominal MRIs in patients with suspected appendicitis. Nine MRI features were studied: appendix diameter >7Â mm, appendicolith, peri-appendiceal fat infiltration, peri-appendiceal fluid, absence of gas in the appendix, appendiceal wall destruction, restricted diffusion of the appendiceal wall, lumen or focal fluid collections. Appendicitis was assigned as the final diagnosis in 117/223 patients. Associations between imaging features and appendicitis were evaluated with logistic regression analysis.<br />RESULTS: All investigated features were significantly associated with appendicitis in univariate analysis. Combinations of two and three features were associated with a probability of appendicitis of 88Â % and 92Â %, respectively. In patients without any of the nine features, appendicitis was present in 2Â % of cases. After multivariate analysis, only an appendix diameter >7Â mm, peri-appendiceal fat infiltration and restricted diffusion of the appendiceal wall were significantly associated with appendicitis. The probability of appendicitis was 96Â % in their presence and 2Â % in their absence.<br />CONCLUSIONS: An appendix diameter >7Â mm, peri-appendiceal fat infiltration and restricted diffusion of the appendiceal wall have the strongest association with appendicitis on MRI.<br />KEY POINTS: â€¢ An enlarged appendix, fat infiltration and restricted diffusion are associated with appendicitis. â€¢ One such feature on MRI gives an 88Â % probability of appendicitis. â€¢ Two features in combination give a probability of appendicitis of 94Â %. â€¢ Combinations of three features give a probability of appendicitis of 96Â %. â€¢ The absence of these features almost rules out appendicitis (2Â %).","24013847","2014","1"
"255","Improvement in the diagnosis of appendicitis.","Advances in surgery","Our attempts to systematically improve accuracy in the evaluation of patients with suspected appendicitis are, in some ways, hindered by the fact that the condition is so frequently straightforward to diagnose. Careful history-taking and physical examination are reliable in most patients. However, establishing the diagnosis with these skills alone remains vulnerable to conditions that masquerade as acute appendicitis. A substantial body of clinical research over the last quarter-century has shown that improved accuracy is possible. Strategies for improvement include the use of diagnostic scoring systems, laboratory makers such as CRP, diagnostic laparoscopy, and advanced imaging modalities such as CT, MRI, and US. How clinicians use these strategies depends on many factors related to practice setting, the population served, and clinical goals. In children, for instance, the desire to limit exposure to ionizing radiation competes with the greater anatomic detail that a CT scan can provide; at the same time, many hospitals that treat children do not have the resources to maintain the sort of full-time, highly sophisticated abdominal US programs that achieve the highest rates of diagnostic accuracy in clinical studies. Trade-offs have to be made, but improvement is possible in almost all groups of patients: the clinical community should no longer settle for a 15% NA rate when 5% is clearly possible without adverse consequences. Many clinicians will be faced with the task of evaluating patients suspected of having acute appendicitis. A deliberate, proactive, and, ideally, benchmarked strategy for improving diagnosis should be the standard to which we hold ourselves and the promise we deliver to our patients.","24298858","2013",\N
"256","Implementation and evaluation of a performance improvement intervention to address physician documentation deficiencies in abdominal ultrasound.","Ultrasound quarterly","PURPOSE: For ultrasound reports to meet criteria for coding as abdomen complete (USABC), 8 elements are required: liver, bile ducts, gallbladder, spleen, kidneys, pancreas, inferior vena cava (IVC), and aorta. Failure to document all 8 results in coding as ultrasound abdomen limited. The purposes of our study were to identify deficiencies in documentation, implement a performance improvement intervention to address deficiencies, and evaluate the intervention.<br />METHODS: In the first phase, 50 consecutive USABC reports performed as part of routine medical care were retrospectively analyzed for the presence or absence of the 8 elements required for USABC coding. Subsequently, education regarding current procedural terminology coding in abdominal ultrasound and standardized macros was provided to radiologists. In the second, postintervention phase, an additional 50 consecutive USABC reports were analyzed for the presence or absence of the 8 elements.<br />RESULTS: In the first phase, none (0%) of 50 reports met criteria for USABC. The most commonly omitted elements were IVC (present in 2% of reports) and aorta (present in 6%). After intervention, there was an increase to 37 reports (74%) meeting criteria for USABC. The most commonly omitted elements were IVC (present in 76%) and aorta (present in 86%). Lack of 100% compliance was secondary to failure to update a macro and inaccurately scheduled studies (focused right lower quadrant/appendicitis study scheduled as USABC).<br />CONCLUSIONS: We improved USABC documentation from 0% to 74%. Our compliance rate after intervention was similar to the 75.1% of previously published larger studies. Our study illustrates the efficacy of simple performance improvement interventions to improve abdominal ultrasound documentation.","24850025","2014","6"

Exclusion criteria were chronic pain, malignancy, prior abdominal surgery, bleeding, peritonitis, and elevated liver enzymes or lipase as defined 3-times higher than upper reference value. All patients underwent first transabdominal ultrasound and were then randomized (1â€‰:â€‰1) to either endoscopy followed by endoscopic ultrasound or vice versa. Patients and respective examiners were blinded to prior findings.<br />RESULTS: A total of 223 patients were included. Endoscopic ultrasound provided a higher diagnostic yield than the combination of transabdominal ultrasound and endoscopy (62.3 vs. 50.7%; pâ€‰=â€‰0.001). For mucosal/intraluminal lesions, we observed a very good agreement between both endoscopic modalities (kappa 0.89). The agreement for pancreatic and biliary causes was good between both ultrasound modalities (kappa 0.66).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Due to its high diagnostic yield, endoscopic ultrasound as a primary diagnostic modality appears to be a valuable option in patients with acute upper abdominal pain.","24917980","2013","10"
"258","Appendectomy in women. Is the laparoscopic approach always better than the \"open\" approach in uncomplicated appendicitis?","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques","BACKGROUND: Acute appendicitis is the most common emergency in abdominal surgery, but remains a continuing controversy regarding the most appropriate method of removing the inflamed appendix.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2002 to December 2012, 1037 women underwent appendectomy (average age: 25Â±15.7 y; range: 6 to 91 y). Of these, 519 underwent open appendectomy (OA) and 518 underwent laparoscopic appendectomy (LA). For all the patients we determined the postoperative hospital stay, the eventual readmissions within 30 days after discharge, the length of surgical procedures (data were available only for the period from January 2008 to December 2012), the costs for the OA and LA, and the rate of negative appendicitis.<br />RESULTS: In our cohort of patients, 189 women (18.2%) had a negative appendectomy. Considering the postoperative hospital stay (average: 4.2Â±3.6 d; range: 1 to 32 d in OA group and average: 3.9Â±3.1 d; range: 1 to 21 d in LA group; P=0.15) there were no statistical differences between 2 groups. The average length of surgical procedures in LA group was 42.3Â±18.4 minutes (range: 8 to 135 min) and 43.2Â±19 minutes in the OA group (range: 10 to 135 min) (P=0.63). The average net cost of LA was 1203.61 euros, whereas for OA it was 95.18 euros. In this study, we considered only the surgical materials.<br />CONCLUSIONS: LAs are not associated with a lower complication rate than the OAs and, above all, LAs are more expensive than OAs. Also we believe that laparoscopic approach should be used only in case of unclear abdominal pain and not for the treatment of clear acute and uncomplicated appendicitis.","24910936","2014","10"
"259","A model to select patients who may benefit from antibiotic therapy as the first line treatment of acute appendicitis at high probability.","Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract","BACKGROUND: Randomized studies indicated that 88-95% of patients with acute appendicitis recover on antibiotics without surgery, although it is unclear which patient would benefit with high probability on antibiotics. We hypothesized that patients with phlegmonous appendicitis should be a group where antibiotics may be a sufficient treatment. Accordingly, our aim was to propose a model to support treatment application for unselected patients with acute appendicitis.<br />METHODS: Retrospective analyses of preoperative clinical and laboratory variables in 384 consecutive adult patients, who underwent appendectomy with histological examination of the appendix, were evaluated by logistic regressions. The proposed mathematical model was then evaluated on a prospectively collected population based material of 581 consecutive patients offered antibiotics as their first line treatment of acute appendicitis.<br />RESULTS: Patients with assumed appendicitis who fulfilled all criteria with CRP <60 g/L, WCC <12â€‰Ã—â€‰10(9)/L, and age <60 years had 89% probability to have phlegmonous appendicitis. When these criteria were applied retrospectively on a prospective material, 88% of operated patients had phlegmonous inflammation and 89% had recovered on antibiotics without surgery.<br />CONCLUSION: Standard clinical and laboratory tests are individually weak predictors of phlegmonous appendicitis, but can be used in combinations as a bedside instrument to select patients suitable for antibiotic therapy.","24263678","2014","5"

The cohort (n = 539) was divided into two groups for analysis: the ASU group, patients admitted on or after 18 July 2011 (n = 283), and the control group, patients admitted prior to 18 July 2011 (n = 256).<br />RESULTS: Median time to operation (1129 min versus 1080 min, P = 0.963) and negative appendicectomy rate (24.2% versus 24.8%, P = 0.871) were similar in both groups. The proportion of operations performed overnight (18.00-08.00 hours) was significantly decreased in the ASU group (17.1% versus 30.7%, P < 0.001). Perforation rate was marginally higher in the ASU group (17.8% versus 11.8%, P = 0.053) but failed to reach statistical significance. There was an increase in the usage of preoperative imaging (40.3% versus 30.5%, P = 0.018) in the ASU group. Operating times, length of stay, laparoscopic-to-open conversion and surgical site infection rates remained similar.<br />CONCLUSION: We conclude that implementation of an ACS model does not lead to objective differences in outcome for patients after appendicectomy. However, the ACS model significantly decreased the number of operations performed after-hours.","24099125","2013","10"

Four patients presented with disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis, 7 with peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis with intermediate or discordant features (intermediate-grade disease), and 8 with peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis. The sonographic characteristics, clinical features, and serum tumor marker levels were recorded and compared among the 3 grades.<br />RESULTS: Clinical symptoms and carcinoembryonic antigen, cancer antigen 125 (CA-125), CA-19-9, CA-724, and CA-153 levels were not significantly different among the 3 pathologic grades (P > .05). Ascites, scalloping of the visceral margin, invasive parenchymal nodules, and peritoneal masses were detected in all grades. Disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis occurred without the finding of an omental cake. The presence of enlarged lymph nodes was more common in peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis. The diagnosis of pseudomyxoma peritonei was made by preoperative sonography in 1 case. Four cases were diagnosed as ovarian mucinous cystadenoma with rupture. One case was diagnosed as a mucinous appendiceal cyst. Four cases were diagnosed as ascites or encapsulated effusion. One case was misdiagnosed as lymphoma. The others were diagnosed as celiac masses.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative sonography can be used to diagnose pseudomyxoma peritonei as long as radiologists are familiar with the imaging features. Although there are overlaps in the sonographic findings among the different grades, some features may aid in separating them.","23980216","2013","9"

The inflamed appendix was right-sided in three, left-sided in three, and in the midline in two patients. Three cases were complicated by a peri-appendicular abscess, and one patient also had a small bowel obstruction. All patients had a complete non-rotation with right-sided duodenum and jejunum, and left-sided colon. All eight patients had an abnormal superior mesenteric artery-superior mesenteric vein (SMA/SMV) relationship and a dysplastic uncinate process of the pancreas. Urgent surgery was performed in six patients and the remaining two were treated conservatively.<br />CONCLUSION: Altered anatomy in malrotation affects the typical clinical and CT findings of acute appendicitis, therefore delaying diagnosis. When CT shows focal inflammation anywhere within the abdomen, along with an abnormal SMA/SMV relationship, the position of the caecum should be ascertained and acute appendicitis ruled out.","23937823","2013","12"

This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the ability of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) to predict acute appendicitis pre-operatively and to differentiate between simple and complicated appendicitis.<br />METHODS: A database of 1067 patients who underwent surgery was evaluated. Based on postoperative histopathological examination, the patients were divided into two groups: acute appendicitis (G1) and normal appendix (G2). Patients in the acute appendicitis group were further divided into two subgroups: simple appendicitis (G1a) and complicated (gangrenous and perforated) appendicitis (G1b).<br />RESULTS: G1 included 897 patients and G2 included 170 patients. Among the 897 G1 patients, there were 753 G1a patients and 144 G1b patients. A NLR of 4.68 was associated with acute appendicitis (G1 vs G2, p<0.001). The sensitivity and specificity were 65.3% and 54.7%, respectively. A NLR of 5.74 was associated with complicated appendicitis (G1a vs G1b, p<0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of the two clinical features were 70.8% and 48.5%, respectively.<br />CONCLUSION: We suggest that preoperative NLR is a useful parameter to aid in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis and differentiate between simple and complicated appendicitis, and can be used as an adjunct to the clinical examination.","24639310","2014","1"

Elevated C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, and serum bilirubin have been suggested as individual markers for appendicitis and appendiceal perforation. The aim of this study was to analyze if a combination of serologic markers could increase the prognostic accuracy of diagnosing non-perforated and perforated appendicitis.<br />MATERIAL AND METHODS: Demographic data, histological findings, blood tests, and clinical symptoms were collected on all patients who underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy, a laparoscopic appendectomy, or conventional (open) appendectomy between May 2009 and May 2012 from a surgical department. The patients were grouped into those with either perforated appendicitis, non-perforated appendicitis, or differential diagnosis. Univariate and multivariate models were used to identify which markers were useful in predicting acute and perforated appendicitis, and receiving operating characteristics curves were used to find the specificity, sensitivity, and the negative and positive predictive values.<br />RESULTS: A total of 1008 patients were operated under suspicion of appendicitis. From these, 700 patients had a pathologically verified inflamed appendix and 190 had a perforated appendix. Patients with acute appendicitis had significantly higher blood levels of white blood cell, bilirubin, C-reactive protein, and alanine transaminase than patients without appendicitis. Patients with perforated appendicitis had significantly higher levels of white blood cell, bilirubin, and C-reactive protein than patients with non-perforated appendicitis. The highest positive predictive value to discriminate between acute appendicitis and non-appendicitis was of a linear regression model combining white blood cell count, bilirubin, and alanine transaminase. C-reactive protein levels and a linear regression model, including white blood cell count, bilirubin, and C-reactive protein levels as variables, had the highest negative predictive values when discriminating between perforated and non-perforated appendicitis.<br />CONCLUSION: Combining blood markers was useful in predicting appendicitis and perforated appendicitis. In addition to C-reactive protein and white cell count, blood levels of bilirubin, and alanine transaminase may be useful.","24737847","2014","4"

It comprised all patients coming to the surgical outpatient department and emergency department with pain in the right iliac fossa with duration less than seven days. They were clinically assessed for signs and symptoms of acute appendicitis and relevant tests were conducted. Patients were diagnosed as a case of acute appendicitis on the basis of clinical and ultrasound findings, and were prepared for appendicectomy. Per-operative findings were recorded and specimens were sent for histopathology to confirm the diagnosis. SPSS version 10 was used to analyse the data.<br />RESULTS: Of the 71 patients, 37 (52.10%) were male and 34 (47.90%) were female. The age range was 3-57 years, and most of the patients (n = 33; 46.5%) were between 11 and 20 years. Besides, 63 (89%) patients had pain in the right iliac fossa of less than four-days duration, while 8 (11%) had pain of longer duration.Total leukocyte count was found to be elevated in 33 (46.5%) patients, while total serum bilirubin was elevated in 41 (57.70%). Ultrasound of abdomen showed 9 (12.70%) patients having normal appearance of appendix and 59 (83.30%) had inflamed appendix. Four (5.60%) patients had no signs of inflammation on naked eye appearance per operatively. Histopathology of appendix showed 10 (14.10%) patients had non-inflammatory appendix.<br />CONCLUSION: Patients with signs and symptoms of acute appendicitis and a raised total serum bilirubin level indicated a complication of acute appendicitis requiring an early intervention to prevent peritonitis and septicaemia. A raised serum bilirubin level is a good indicator of complicated acute appendicitis, and should be included in the assessment of patients with suspected complicated acute appendicitis.","24392522","2013","11"

The patient population was obtained using the Vidant Medical Center Trauma Registry from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2006. The abdomen was divided into nine regions using the mid-clavicular lines, superior anterior iliac spine, and umbilicus. A single Board-certified radiologist determined the region location of the appendix.<br />RESULTS: Forty-five patients were identified and 35 were studied. Ten patients were excluded due to appendix not identified, unknown gestational age, or inability to review the CT study. In 21 of 22 third-trimester pregnancies, the appendix was not found in the right lower region (RLR), which corresponded to the RLQ. All 11 patients in the second trimester did not have the appendix in the RLR.

Urinalysis was performed in patients with clinically suspected acute appendicitis before surgical intervention. Routine urinalysis is composed of 2 examinations: chemical tests for abnormal chemical constituents and microscopic tests for abnormal insoluble constituents. Receiver operating characteristic curves for urine white blood cell (WBC) counts and urine red blood cell (RBC) counts in distinguishing between patients with simple appendicitis and patients with perforated appendicitis were also analyzed.<br />MAIN FINDINGS: Urine ketone bodies, leukocyte esterase, specific gravity, pH, WBC, and RBC counts were all significant parameters among patients with normal appendices, simple appendicitis, and perforated appendicitis (all P < .05). Based on multivariate logistic regression analysis, positive urine ketone bodies and nitrate were significant parameters in predicting perforated appendicitis (P = .002 and P = .008, respectively). According to the results of receiver operating characteristic curves, the appropriate cutoff values were 2.0/high-power field for urine RBC counts and 4.0/high-power field for urine WBC counts in predicting perforated appendicitis in children.<br />PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS: Routine urinalysis may serve to aid in discriminating between simple and perforated appendicitis.

In all, 877 (75%) patients were admitted to the ACS service. Overall, 83% of patients underwent surgery within 6 hours. The mean wait time from CT request to obtaining the CT scan decreased with pathway implementation at all sites (197 v. 143 min, p < 0.001). This improvement was sustained at 12-month followup (131 min, p < 0.001). The pathway increased the number of CTs completed in under 2 hours from 3% to 42% (p < 0.001). No decrease in the total number of CTs or the pattern of ultrasonography was noted (p = 0.42). Wait times from ED triage to surgery were shortened (665 min preimplementation, 633 min postimplementation, 631 min at the 12-month follow-up, p = 0.040).<br />CONCLUSION: A clinical care pathway dedicated to suspected appendicitis can decrease times to both CT scan and surgical intervention.","24869612","2014","6"
"271","Comparison of clinical outcomes of open, laparoscopic and single port appendicectomies.","Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England","INTRODUCTION: Appendicectomy is the most common surgical procedure performed in general surgery. This study aimed to compare the outcomes of open appendicectomy (OA), laparoscopic appendicectomy (LA) and single port laparoscopic appendicectomy (SPLA).<br />METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients with suspected acute appendicitis were studied (OA: n=20, LA: n=20, SPLA: n=10). Clinical outcomes were compared between the three groups in terms of operative time, blood loss, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay and cost.<br />RESULTS: Patient demographics were similar among groups (p>0.05). SPLA was characterised by longer operative time (88.1 minutes vs 35.6 minutes in OA and 33.4 minutes in LA) and higher costs (12.84 thousand Chinese yuan [RMB] vs 8.41 thousand RMB in LA and 4.99 thousand RMB in OA). OA was characterised by more blood loss (9.8ml vs 7.5ml in SPLA and 6.8ml in LA), longer hospital stay (7.5 days vs 3.5 days in LA and 3.4 days in SPLA) and lower costs. The total number of complications was higher for OA (n=2) than for LA and SPLA (n=0) although this was not statistically significant.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Where feasible, LA should be undertaken as the initial treatment of choice for most cases of suspected appendicitis.","24112490","2013","10"
"272","Granulomatous appendicitis in children: a single institutional experience.","African journal of paediatric surgery : AJPS","BACKGROUND: Granulomatous appendicitis (GA) is a rare entity, mostly mentioned in adults. There have been anecdotal case reports describing GA in the paediatric population. This study was aimed at reviewing the cases of appendectomies to assess the incidence and characteristics of GA in children in a tertiary care University hospital.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: Records of children (<13 years age) with biopsy proven granulomatous lesions in the appendectomy specimen, treated during 1991-2011, were analysed. Data regarding demography, clinical presentation, radiological findings, intra-operative finding, histology, diagnosis and follow-up were recorded and descriptively analysed.<br />RESULTS: Twelve out of 1150 (1.04%) appendectomies were biopsy proven GA. Male to female ratio was 8:4. Four had Yersinia enterocolitis, two had Crohn's disease (CD; one isolated Crohn's Appendicitis, one Ileo-cecal Crohn' with appendicitis) and five were idiopathic. Remaining one case, initially diagnosed as idiopathic GA, developed full blown ileo-cecal CD at 2 nd month post-operative. Age ranged between 4 and 11 years with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affecting older children and Yersinia, seen in younger children. Majority (10/12) remained asymptomatic at a maximum of 5 years of follow-up. Two patients had recurrent symptoms; one with sub-acute obstruction (2 years follow-up) and another with flaring of Crohn's ileitis (2 months follow-up).<br />CONCLUSIONS: GA in children is a rare entity, with incidence of 1.04% and male preponderance in our series. Idiopathic causes were the most common followed by Yersinia enterocolitis and CD. Although majority remained asymptomatic, IBD should be ruled out in case of recurrence of pain or alteration of bowel habit. Therefore, a long-term follow-up (at least for 5 years) of idiopathic GA is suggested in children.","24647289",\N,\N

"274","[What imaging to choose for low abdominal pain?].","Revue mÃ©dicale suisse","Nowadays, we need to counterbalance the excellent diagnostic yield of the abdominal CT Scan, with the significant risks of X irradiation. The Low Dose CT Scan allows confirmation of a diagnosis of appendicitis or nephrolithiasis with comparable precision and a much lower irradiation dose. In the case of appendicitis, the ultrasound is particularly useful, provided that the patient's BMI is <30. If there is suspicion of diverticulitis, the standard CT Scan remains the first line test. The Ultrasound is the first choice exam for a woman in childbearing age presenting with an acute abdominal pain.","24163878","2013","9"
"275","Routine histopathologic examination of two common surgical specimens-appendix and gallbladder: is it a waste of expertise and hospital resources?","The Indian journal of surgery","This study was undertaken to assess whether a routine histopathologic examination of two common surgical specimens (appendix and gallbladder) is needed and whether routine histopathologic examination has an impact on further management of patients. Histopathology reports of patients who had undergone appendicectomy and cholecystectomy, between 2006 and 2010, were analyzed retrospectively in the department of pathology of a tertiary care hospital. The case notes were retrieved in all cases of malignancies. Patients having a clinical diagnosis or suspicion of malignancy were excluded. The incidence and impact of unexpected pathologic diagnosis on postoperative management were noted. The study period included a total of 1,123 and 711 appendicectomy and cholecystectomy specimens, respectively. Fifteen (1.336Â %) cases of appendicectomy specimens revealed incidental unexpected pathological diagnoses, which included tubercular appendicitis (nâ€‰=â€‰2), parasite (nâ€‰=â€‰8), neuroma (nâ€‰=â€‰1), carcinoid (nâ€‰=â€‰2), pseudomyxoma (nâ€‰=â€‰1), and adenocarcinoma (nâ€‰=â€‰1). About 88Â % of such unexpected appendiceal findings had an impact on postoperative treatment. Unexpected pathologic gallbladder findings were found in 12 (1.68Â %) of 711 cholecystectomy specimens. In 6 (0.84Â %) cases, gallbladder cancer (GBC) was detected. Additional further management was required in 50Â % of patients with unexpected gallbladder findings. Twenty of the total 1,834 specimens (1.090Â %) had an impact on patient management or outcome and were not suspected on macroscopic examination at the time of surgery. These would have been missed had the specimens not been examined microscopically. The intraoperative diagnosis of the surgeon is therefore sometimes doubtful in detecting abnormalities of the appendix and gallbladder. This study supports the sending of all appendicectomy and cholecystectomy specimens for routine histopathological examination. Appendix and gallbladder should undergo routine histopathological examination. This is important in patients with advanced age and gallstones. Also, it is of great value in identifying unsuspected conditions which require further postoperative management. Selectively sending specimens for histopathological examination can result in reduced workload on the histopathology department without compromising patient safety.","24891777","2014","4"
"276","Diagnosing abdominal tuberculosis in the acute abdomen.","International journal of surgery (London, England)","BACKGROUND: Despite recent improvements in medical treatments, the incidence of abdominal tuberculosis (ATB) in the United Kingdom has increased over the past two decades. This case series examined the difficulties encountered in correctly diagnosing this infection.<br />PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was undertaken, reviewing the records of 36 patients diagnosed with ATB from 2000 to 2012 at a district general hospital in outer East London.<br />RESULTS: The commonest presenting feature was abdominal pain in 67% of patients, and the most common sites of infection were the iliocaecal junction and peritoneum, seen in 36.1% and 33.3% respectively. Six patients were initially investigated for Crohn's disease and one for ileitis. The highest disease prevalence was seen in patients born in India and Pakistan, which was 27.8% and 19.4% of patients respectively. Colonoscopy was performed in nine patients, and three of these reported normal findings. The other six reported visible non-specific inflammatory changes. Three patients had abdominal X-rays reported and one patient had an abdominal ultrasound, all of which were normal. An abdominal computerised topography (CT) scan was performed in 26 patients and a chest CT was undertaken in 19 patients. Varying degrees of inflammatory changes were seen in all of the patients who had CT scans. Microbiological culture was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis or acid-fast bacilli in 71% of patients.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal tuberculosis can be very difficult to diagnose as symptoms are non-specific and can mimic other types of granulomatous inflammatory bowel diseases. Radiology appears largely unhelpful due to the non-specificity of any positive imaging findings, and there is a lack of diagnostic procedural and microbiological tests with high specificity and sensitivity. In view of the increasing incidence of tuberculosis in London, there should be a high index of suspicion for ATB in individuals from high-incidence countries who present with non-specific abdominal symptoms.","24560849","2014",\N

Over 18 months, patients with known pelvic DIE who were scheduled for surgery were recruited. Consecutive patients suspected of having bowel endometriosis above the rectosigmoid junction underwent 3.0-T MR enterography. Two blinded readers independently performed a systematic analysis of nine bowel segments above the rectosigmoid junction. MR images were compared with surgical and pathologic findings. Efficacy parameters were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Interobserver agreement was assessed with Îº statistics.<br />RESULTS: Among the 43 patients enrolled in this study, 33 underwent surgery and were included in the final analyses. Sixteen (48%) patients had bowel DIE lesions located above the rectosigmoid junction at surgery and histopathologic examination. Twenty-six lesions were analyzed, including four ileal, two ileocecal, three cecal, three appendicular, and 14 sigmoid colon lesions. For the diagnosis of these lesions, MR imaging showed sensitivities of 92% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 81.7, 100) for reader 1 and 96% (95% CI: 87.1, 100) for reader 2 and specificities of 100% (95% CI: 98.8, 100) for both readers. The Îº value was 0.97.<br />CONCLUSION: These results show 3.0-T MR enterography is accurate in the preoperative diagnosis and mapping of bowel DIE lesions located above the rectosigmoid junction.

The surgical charts of all patients aged between 0 and 14 years treated with transumbilical laparoscopic-assisted appendectomy admitted to the authors' institution from January 2009 to September 2013 with a diagnosis of suspected appendicitis following clinical, laboratory and ultrasound findings were reviewed. Operating time, intraoperative findings, need for conversion or for additional trocars, and surgical complications were reported. During the study period, 120 patients aged between 6 and 14 years (mean age: 9.9 years), 73 females (61%) and 47 males (39%), were treated with transumbilical laparoscopic-assisted appendectomy. There were 37 cases of hyperemic appendicitis (subserosal and retrocecal), 74 cases of phlegmonous appendicitis and 9 cases of perforated gangrenous appendicitis. It was not possible to establish a correlation between grade of appendicitis and mean operating time (P > 0.05). Eleven cases (9%) needed the use of one additional trocar, while 8 patients (6%) required conversion to the standard laparoscopic technique with the use of two additional trocars. No patient was converted to the open technique. Transumbilical laparoscopic-assisted appendectomy is a safe technique in children and it could be used by surgeons who want to approach other minimally invasive techniques.","24748916","2014","4"

American journal of roentgenology","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare CT with conventional and simulated reduced-tube current in the evaluation for acute appendicitis in children.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: Validated noise-addition (tube current-reduction) software was used to create 50% and 75% tube current reductions in 60 CT examinations performed for suspected appendicitis, resulting in 180 image sets. Three blinded pediatric radiologists scored the randomized studies for the following factors: presence of the normal appendix or appendicitis (5-point scale; 1=definitely absent and 5=definitely present), presence of alternate diagnoses, and overall image quality (1=nondiagnostic and 5=excellent). Truth was defined by the interpretation of the conventional examination.<br />RESULTS: For conventional examinations, the total number of reviews (60 casesÃ—3 readers=180) in which the normal appendix was identified was 120 of 180 (66.7%), compared with 108 of 180 (60%) in the 50% (p=0.19) and 91 of 180 (50.6%) in the 75% (p=0.002) tube current-reduction groups. Appendicitis was identified in a total of 39 of 180 (21.7%), 38 of 180 (21.1%), and 37 of 180 (20.6%) examinations, respectively (p>0.05). This translates to sensitivities of 97% and 95% for the 50% and 75% tube current-reduction groups, respectively. Alternate diagnoses were detected in 14%, 16%, and 13% of scans, respectively. Compared with conventional-tube current examinations, reader confidence and assessment of image quality were significantly decreased for both tube current-reduction groups.<br />CONCLUSION: Simulated tube current-reduction technology provides for systematic evaluation of diagnostic thresholds. Application of this technology in the setting of suspected appendicitis shows that tube current can be reduced by at least 50% without significantly affecting diagnostic quality, despite a decrease in reader confidence and assessment of image quality.","23971460","2013","9"
"284","Role of laparoscopy in peritonitis.","Pakistan journal of medical sciences","OBJECTIVE: Laparoscopy has gained clinical acceptance in many subspecialties in the last decade. The conventional open surgery for peritonitis carries significant morbidity and mortality. The present study was done to extend and evaluate benefits of minimally invasive surgery in this subset of patients.<br />METHODS: This was a prospective study spanning over a period of four years. All those patients diagnosed as having peritonitis on clinical assessment and preoperative investigations and those who were stable enough haemodynamically were included in this study. After initial resuscitation for few hours, they underwent diagnostic and therapeutic laparoscopy to identify the cause of peritonitis and to confirm the pathology. All cases were done under general anesthesia, using three standard ports at appropriate sites according to pathology. Patients were treated by different procedures either laparoscopically or with laparoscopic assistance after diagnosis. Operative and post operative data was collected and analyzed.<br />RESULTS: Ninety two cases of peritonitis underwent diagnostic and therapeutic laparoscopy. Mean age of patient was 46.5 years. 24 patients were diagnosed as perforated duodenal, in 14 (58.3%) patients laparoscopic suture repair was done and in 8 (33.3%) small upper midline incision was given and perforation was repaired. Out of 32 patients having perforated appendix, 25 (78.1%) patients laparoscopic appendectomy was done while in 7 (21.8%) perforation was dealt by laparoscopic assistance. Out of 14 patients of ileal perforation 6 (42.8%) with minimal contamination laparoscopic suture was applied, while in 8 (57.1%), perforated loop was brought out by making small window and perforation was closed. All 22 patients with pelvic sepsis needed only aspiration of pus and peritoneal lavage. Only one patient died post operatively and 2 (2.1%) patients developed fistula. 6 (6.5%) patients developed port site infection.<br />CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic management is feasible, safe and effective surgical option for patients with peritonitis due to different abdominal emergencies in properly selected cases with higher diagnostic yield and a faster postoperative recovery.","24353681","2013","7"

Diagnosis is usually based on the clinical findings, and the threshold for empiric antibiotic therapy should be low. However, at least in cases of resistance toward therapy or deterioration of symptoms, laparoscopic evaluation can be helpful.<br />METHODS: We searched the hospital charts for in-house patients who were treated for PID or tubo-ovarian abscess between 2007 and 2010. In cases with both vaginal and intra-abdominal bacterial cultures, results of those were compared.<br />RESULTS: 73 patients with suspected PID or tubo-ovarian abscess were included. Median patients' age was 40 years (18-88), 18 of 73 (24.7 %) patients had an IUD at the time of consultation. 58 patients underwent laparoscopy or laparotomy. In 41 patients (70.7 %) tubo-ovarian abscess could be confirmed, four patients had differential gynecologic diagnoses, and two patients appendicitis. In vaginal swabs, most frequent bacteria were Streptococcus sp. (28.5 %), Escherichia coli (22.2 %), Enterococcus faecalis (15.9 %), and Staphylococcus sp. (9.5 %). In eight patients (11 %) Chlamydia trachomatis could be found, there was no case of Neisseria gonorrhea. In 33 patients both vaginal and abdominal cultures were available. In nine cases (27.3 %), identical bacteria could be found, however, 11 cases (33.3 %) showed different results.<br />CONCLUSION: In severe cases of PID, laparoscopic evaluation and taking an intra-abdominal bacterial culture are helpful for the confirmation of diagnosis, accurate microbiologic testing and specific therapy.","24474636","2014","6"

We collected data on patient demographics; length of symptoms; times of presentation, admission and surgery; antibiotic administration; operative findings; and occurrence of SSI.<br />RESULTS: 1388 patients were analyzed. SSI occurred in 5.1% of all patients, 1.4% of simple appendicitis (SA) patients, and 12.4% of complex appendicitis (CA) patients. SSI did not increase significantly as the length of time between ED triage and operation increased (all patients, p=0.51; SA patients, p=0.91; CA patients, p=0.44) or with increased time from admission to operation (all patients, p=0.997; SA patients, p=0.69; CA patients, p=0.96). However, greater length of symptoms was associated with an increased risk of SSI (p<0.05 for all, SA and CA patients). In univariable analysis, obesity, and increased admission WBC count were each associated with significantly increased SSI. In multivariable analysis, only CA was a significant risk factor for SSI (p<0.0001).<br />CONCLUSION: We found no significant increase in the risk of SSI related to delay in appendectomy. A future multi-institutional study is planned to confirm these results.","24888856","2014","6"

"291","Limited added utility of performing follow-up contrast-enhanced CT in patients undergoing initial non-enhanced CT for evaluation of flank pain in the emergency department.","Emergency radiology","In our emergency department (ED), patients with flank pain often undergo non-enhanced computed tomography (NECT) to assess for nephroureteral (NU) stone. After immediate image review, decision is made regarding need for subsequent contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) to help assess for other causes of pain. This study aimed to review the experience of a single institution with this protocol and to assess the utility of CECT. Over a 6Â month period, we performed a retrospective analysis on ED patients presenting with flank pain undergoing CT for a clinical diagnosis of nephroureterolithiasis. Patients initially underwent abdominopelvic NECT. The interpreting radiologist immediately decided whether to obtain a CECT to evaluate for another etiology of pain. Medical records, CT reports and images, and 7-day ED return were reviewed. CT diagnoses on NECT and CECT were compared. Additional information from CECT and changes in management as documented in the patient's medical record were noted. Three hundred twenty-two patients underwent NECT for obstructing NU stones during the study period. Renal or ureteral calculi were detected in 143/322 (44.4Â %). One hundred fifty-four patients (47.8Â %) underwent CECT. CECT added information in 17/322 cases (5.3Â %) but only changed management in 6/322 patients (1.9Â %). In four of these patients with final diagnosis of renal infarct, splenic infarct, pyelonephritis and early acute appendicitis in a thin patient, there was no abnormality on the NECT (4/322 patients, 1.2Â %). In the remaining 2 patients, an abnormality was visible on the NECT. In patients presenting with flank pain with a clinical suspicion of nephroureterolithiasis, CECT may not be indicated. While CECT provided better delineation of an abnormality in 5.3Â % of cases, changes in management after CECT occurred only in 2Â %. This included 1Â % of patients in whom a diagnosis of organ infarct, pyelonephritis or acute appendicitis in a thin patient could only be made on CECT.","25082439","2014","8"

"293","Journal club: The pediatric appendix: defining normal.","AJR. American journal of roentgenology","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to characterize the normal pediatric appendix and the variables that affect its diameter.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: Imaging and medical records, including CT studies, from 420 unique patients with normal appendixes were reviewed by two pediatric radiologists. Appendiceal diameter was measured on the axial images, and appendiceal content and the presence of enlarged lymph nodes were recorded.<br />RESULTS: The mean appendiceal diameter was 5.6 Â± 1.4 and 5.7 Â± 1.5 mm for reviewer 1 and reviewer 2, respectively, with 34% and 39% of appendixes measuring larger than 6 mm. Appendiceal diameter was normally distributed across the population and was significantly associated with patient age (p < 0.0001). Diameter increased by 0.4 mm/y until 6-7 years of age, after which, it remained stable. The quantity of pericecal fat (p = 0.03 and p < 0.0001) and type of appendiceal content (p = 0.0002 and p < 0.0001), respectively, were multivariate predictors of diameter. Lymphoid stimulation was a multivariate predictor of diameter for only one reviewer (p = 0.0008). Patient sex and the month or season of imaging were not predictors of diameter.<br />CONCLUSION: Uniform diameter cutoffs for appendiceal diameter should not be applied across the pediatric population because the appendix grows during childhood. Additionally, this study calls into question a 6-mm diameter cutoff for appendicitis. Normal pediatric appendixes measure up to 8.7 mm, with up to 39% measuring more than 6 mm in diameter. Nonpathologic factors, including pericecal fat, appendiceal content, and presence of lymphoid stimulation, influence appendiceal diameter in healthy children.","24758645","2014","5"
"294","The accuracy of the Alvarado score in predicting acute appendicitis in the black South African population needs to be validated.","Canadian journal of surgery. Journal canadien de chirurgie","BACKGROUND: The Alvarado score is the most widely used clinical prediction tool to facilitate decision-making in patients with acute appendicitis, but it has not been validated in the black South African population, which has much wider differential diagnosis than developed world populations. We investigated the applicability of this score to our local population and sought to introduce a checklist for rural doctors to facilitate early referral.<br />METHODS: We analyzed patients with proven appendicitis for the period January 2008 to December 2012. Alvarado scores were retrospectively assigned based on patients' admission charts. We generated a clinical probability score (1-4 = low, 5-6 = intermediate, 7-10 = high).<br />RESULTS: We studied 1000 patients (54% male, median age 21 yr). Forty percent had inflamed, nonperforated appendices and 60% had perforated appendices. Alvarado scores were 1-4 in 20.9%, 5-6 in 35.7% and 7-10 in 43.4%, indicating low, intermediate and high clincial probability, respectively. In our subgroup analysis of 510 patients without generalized peritonitis, Alvarado scores were 1-4 in 5.5%, 5-6 in 18.1% and 7-10 in 76.4%, indicating low, intermediate and high clinical probability, respectively.<br />CONCLUSION: The widespread use of the Alvarado score has its merits, but its applicability in the black South African population is unclear, with a significant proportion of patients with the disease being potentially missed. Further prospective validation of the Alvarado score and possible modification is needed to increase its relevance in our setting.","25078937","2014","8"

Patients were divided into complicated and uncomplicated cohorts and examined for interhospital variation in the use of diagnostic imaging (computed tomography or ultrasonography), laboratory tests, parenteral nutrition (PN), peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC), and hospital cost. The number and distribution of statistical outliers were calculated for all measures.<br />RESULTS: Significant variation was found for all measures, including a 3.5-fold difference in preoperative imaging (aggregate rate: 49.0%, range across hospitals: 21.2%-73.5%, P < 0.001) and a 5-fold difference in preoperative laboratory utilization (aggregate median: 2 tests/encounter, range: 1-5 tests/encounter, P < 0.001). For patients with complicated appendicitis, we characterized a 12-fold difference in postoperative imaging (aggregate rate: 19.4%, range: 4.9%-61.6%, P < 0.001), a 48-fold difference in PICC lines (aggregate rate: 18.9%, range: 1.7%-81.8%, P < 0.001), and a 100-fold difference in PN utilization (aggregate rate: 9.3%, range: 0.4%-42.0%, P < 0.001). Median hospital cost differed 4-fold for patients with uncomplicated disease (aggregate median: $6804, range: $4200-$16,796, P < 0.001) and 4.6-fold for patients with complicated disease (aggregate median: $13,138, range: $5419-$24,779, P < 0.001). Statistical outliers on the basis of high and low utilization were identified for all measures.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Significant variation exists in practice, resource utilization, and treatment-related cost associated with the management of appendicitis at freestanding children's hospitals. Value-based measures are needed for benchmarking and to prioritize collaborative quality improvement efforts.","24096770","2014","6"
"296","Role of diagnostic laparoscopy in chronic and recurrent abdominal pain.","Tropical gastroenterology : official journal of the Digestive Diseases Foundation","BACKGROUND: Chronic abdominal pain is a very common condition presenting to a general surgeon. It is defined as pain lasting for more than 3 months. Sometimes, the diagnosis cannot be established even with the help of advanced radiological investigations. This study aims to define the role of laparoscopy in diagnosing the cause of chronic abdominal pain and thus enabling a definitive management.<br />METHODS: The study included 52 patients admitted to the Department of Surgery, Himalayan Institute of Medical Sciences, Dehradun, India for chronic abdominal pain of unknown origin. All patients underwent diagnostic laparoscopy with methodical inspection of the whole abdomen.<br />RESULTS: Diagnosis was established in 86.5% of cases either by direct visualization or histopathological examination. The most common pathology was chronic appendicitis (19%) followed by adhesions (17.3%) and peritoneal tuberculosis (15.3%). A therapeutic procedure was done in 46% of cases during laparoscopy. No major complication was reported during the study.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopy is a safe and effective method to diagnose the cause of chronic abdominal pain in cases where other non-invasive methods prove unreliable.","24851527",\N,\N
"297","Clinical correlation needed: what do emergency physicians do after an equivocal ultrasound for pediatric acute appendicitis?","Journal of clinical ultrasound : JCU","BACKGROUND: Although follow-up CT is recommended for pediatric appendicitis if initial ultrasound (US) is equivocal, many physicians observe the patient at home. There are limited data to understand currently how common or safe this practice is. Our objectives are to assess prevalence of acute appendicitis and outcomes in patients with equivocal US with and without follow-up CT and to identify variables associated with ordering a follow-up CT.<br />METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the prevalence of appendicitis and outcomes of patients 1-18 years old with an equivocal US at a pediatric emergency department from 2003 to 2008. Recursive partitioning analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used to identify variables associated with ordering follow-up CT.<br />RESULTS: Fifty-five percent (340/620) of children with equivocal US did not receive CT, none of whom returned with a missed appendicitis. The prevalence of appendicitis in children with equivocal US was 12.5% (78/620). In children with follow-up CT, the prevalence was 22.1% (62/280); in those without follow-up CT, the prevalence was 4.7% (16/340). Recursive partitioning identified age >11 years, leukocytosis >15,000 cells/ml, and secondary signs predisposing toward acute appendicitis on US as significant predictors of CT.<br />CONCLUSIONS: We view our study as a fundamental part of the incremental progress to understand how best to use US and CT imaging to diagnose pediatric appendicitis while minimizing ionizing radiation. Children at low risk for appendicitis with equivocal US are amenable to observation and reassessment prior to reimaging with US or CT.","24700515","2014","9"

The Italian surveillance program RotaNet-Italia collected 1,595 samples from patients admitted to hospital with gastroenteritis in 2012. All patients presented with vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and/or abdominal pain. Forty-two samples obtained by the RotaNet-Italia (2.6%) were from adolescents or adults (10-89 years). The study compared the genotypes and gene sequences of the rotavirus strains identified in adults with strains obtained from children worldwide. All 42 Italian strains were genotyped by the EuroRotaNet RT-nested-PCR protocols, and 12 rotaviruses from patients >13-year-old were subjected to nucleotide sequencing of their VP7 and/or VP4 genes. All strains analyzed belonged to the common human genotypes G1P[8], G2P[4], G4P[8], and G9P[8], except an uncommon G3P[19] genotype detected in a single patient. Phylogenetic analysis of the 12 strains showed that within each genotype they clustered in RVA lineages reported worldwide. The amino acid sequences of the VP7 and the VP8* hypervariable regions were highly conserved between the RVA strains collected from adults and children, in each lineage. Genotyping, phylogenetic analysis, and the study of viral epitopes revealed that rotaviruses circulating in adults in Italy are closely similar to the strains circulating in children, with high nucleotide identity particularly with strains reported in Europe and Asia. The circulation of the same rotavirus strains in both children and adults suggests that adults may contribute to sustain the circulation of rotaviruses through the population.","24415411","2014","6"

Patients with pathologically proven appendicitis and pre-operative US from January 2011 to May 2013 were included in this retrospective case-control study. They were divided into true-positive and false-negative groups, matched by age and gender. There were 112 patients (40 men, mean age = 40 y, 56 true positives) included. Two factors were found differ significantly: abdominal wall thickness and pain score. Greater abdominal wall thickness (18.6 mm vs. 14.9 mm, p = 0.001) and lower pain score (6.6 vs. 7.5, p = 0.018) were statistically associated with false negativity. The two groups did not differ significantly in terms of weight, height, body mass index, symptom duration, Alvarado score, US examination time, appendix position/size, perforation rate and operator. In conclusion, lower pain score and increased abdominal wall thickness are associated with false negativity in US examinations.","24768483","2014","7"

"302","Appendicitis: what does really make the difference between private and public hospitals?","BMC emergency medicine","BACKGROUND: Appendicitis is one of the most common surgical emergencies and is also a time-sensitive condition. Delays in treatment increase the risk of appendiceal perforation (AP), and thus AP rates have been used as a proxy to measure access to surgical care. It is very well known that in Brazil there are big differences between the public and private healthcare systems. Those differences can reflect in the treatment of what are considered simple cases, like appendicitis. As far as we know, it has no known links to behavioral or social risk factors, and has only one treatment option--appendectomy. The purpose of this study was to compare treatment received by Brazilian people, both by those who depend on the public and private healthcare system, and how it affects their outcome.<br />METHODS: Data was collected from the records of all patients submitted to appendectomy, in a public and in a private Sao Paulo city's hospitals, during January to April of 2010.<br />RESULTS: Patients admitted by the public hospital present symptoms for a longer period of time than those treated by the private one. It took a significantly higher amount of time for the patients from the public hospital undergo surgery, and their length of stay is also significantly higher.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Appendicitis in a public scenario is associated with increased time from onset of symptoms to operative intervention and the main reason is the delayed presentation. Clinical polices for abdominal pain should be instituted by the public healthcare system, based on population education, healthcare professionals training and establishment of strategies that can speed the diagnosis process up.","23890214","2013",\N

Objective. To compare outcomes of urban and rural patients in KwaZulu-Natal and to determine whether there are disparities in outcome.<br />METHODS: We conducted a prospective study from September 2010 to September 2012 at Edendale Hospital in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. All patients who presented with acute appendicitis were included. The operative and clinical course of urban and rural patients was compared. Results. A total of 500 patients were included, with 200 patients in the rural group and 300 in the urban group. Those from the rural group had a significantly longer duration of symptoms prior to presentation. All septic parameters were significantly worse in the rural group. Significantly more patients from the rural group required a laparotomy (77% v. 51% urban; p<0.001). Inflamed, non-perforated appendicitis was more commonly seen in the urban group (52.3% v. 21% rural; p<0.001), while perforated appendicitis was much more common in the rural group (79% v. 47.7% urban; p<0.001). Perforation associated with generalised, four-quadrant intra-abdominal contamination was significantly higher in the rural group than the urban group (60.5% v. 21%, respectively; p<0.05). Significantly more patients from the rural group required an open abdomen (46% v. 12% urban; p<0.001) and â‰¥1 re-laparotomies to control severe intra-abdominal sepsis (60.5% v. 23.3% urban; p<0.001).<br />CONCLUSION: We have identified rural origin as an independent indicator of poor outcome.

The long-term morbidity, mortality and quality of life of the patients with NSAP compared to AA are unknown.<br />METHODS: The study group consisted of 186 patients with acute NSAP compared to 147 patients with AA initially treated during 1985-1986. Medical history, social background, quality of life and abdominal symptoms were assessed with standardized questionnaires in both groups during 2006-2009. The patients who continued to have abdominal symptoms were invited to a check-up visit.<br />RESULTS: During 1985-6, the NSAP group had more previous abdominal symptoms and operations than the AA group. Some 29% of patients with NSAP and 11% of patients with AA had still abdominal symptoms at long-term check-up (p < 0.0001). Chronic abdominal pain (38 vs 17) and peptic ulcer disease (18 vs 2) occurred more often in the NSAP group than in the controls, respectively (p = 0.001). After five years of follow-up, 11 patients in the NSAP group and 6 patients in the AA group had died (ns).

"307","Identification and potential use of a molecular marker for rust resistance in common bean.","TAG. Theoretical and applied genetics. Theoretische und angewandte Genetik","The Up 2 gene of common bean (Phaseolus Vulgaris L.) is an important source of dominant genetic resistance to the bean rust pathogen [Uromyces appendiculatus (Pers. ex Pers.) Unger var 'appendiculatus' [syn U. Phaseoli (Reben) Wint.]. Up 2 in combination with other rust resistance genes may be used to obtain potentially stable genetic resistance. It is difficult, however, to combine rust resistance genes effective against a single race due to epistatic interactions that frequently occur between them. A strategy that employed bulked DNA samples formed separately from the DNA of three BC6F2 individuals with Up 2 and three without Up 2 as contrasting near-isogenic lines (NILs) was used to identify random amplified polymorphic DNA fragments (RAPDs) tightly linked to the Up 2 locus. Only 1 of 931 fragments amplified by 167 10-mer primers of arbitrary sequence in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was polymorphic. The RAPD marker (OA141100) amplified by the 5'-TCTGTGCTGG-3' primer was repeatable and its presence and absence easy to score. No recombination was observed between OA141100 and the dominant Up 2 allele within a segregating BC6F2 population of 84 individuals. This result suggests that OA141100 and Up 2 are tightly linked. Andean and Mesoamerican bean germ plasm, with and without the Up 2 allele, were assayed for the presence of OA141100. Apparently, the marker is of Andean origin because all Andean lines, with or without the Up 2 allele, contained the marker, and the marker was absent in all Mesoamerican germ plasm except the lines to which Up-2 had been purposely transferred. These results suggest that OA141100 will be most useful for pyramiding Up 2 with other rust resistance genes into germ plasm of Mesoamerican origin where the marker does not traditionally exist. The use of bulked DNA samples may have concentrated resources toward the identification of RAPDs that were tightly linked to the target locus. Marker-based selection may provide an alternative to the time-consuming testcrosses required to pyramid bean rust resistance genes that exhibit epistasis.","24196045","1993","2"

They were divided into two, group I (age<21 years) and group II (age e\"21 years). The indices analyzed were the relationship of age group, occupation on orchidectomy and unilateral orchidopexy and seasonal variation and torsion. Cases of acute epididymo-orchitis, torsion of appendix testis, and testicular tumor were excluded from the study.<br />RESULTS: A total of 169 confirmed cases of testicular torsion were analysed.The estimated incidence was 12.1 cases per 100,000 populations.

The representative guidelines applied in a retrospective simulation included the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), National Institute of Clinical Excellence, top-down approach (TDA), and Italian Society of Pediatric Nephrology (ISPN). These were compared in terms of ability to detect abnormalities, procedural costs and radiation.<br />RESULTS: Of 278 children analyzed, 172 (61.9%) had acute pyelonephritis. There was VUR in 101 (36.3%) children, including 73 (26.3%) with grades III-V VUR. RS was identified in 75 (27.0%) children. To detect VUR, TDA and PCT had the highest sensitivity for grades I-V VUR (80.2%) and III-V VUR (94.5%), respectively, whereas AAP had the highest specificity for I-V VUR (77.4%) and III-V VUR (78.0%), respectively. TDA and PCT had the highest sensitivity (100%) for detecting RS. The highest cost and radiation dose was associated with TDA, whereas AAP had the least expenditure and radiation exposure. By multivariate analysis, PCT and VUR, especially grades III-V, were independent predictors of RS.<br />CONCLUSIONS: There is no perfect guideline for first febrile UTI children. The PCT protocol has good ability for detecting high-grade VUR and RS. If based on available imaging modalities and reducing cost and radiation burden, clinical suggestions in the AAP guidelines represent a considerable protocol.","24648130","2014","9"

We then performed proteome-wide analysis and validated these observations in five large cohorts of patients with systemic sclerosis. Next, we compared the results with those in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis, and hepatic fibrosis. We correlated plasma levels of CXCL4 protein with features of systemic sclerosis and studied the direct effects of CXCL4 in vitro and in vivo.<br />RESULTS: Proteome-wide analysis and validation showed that CXCL4 is the predominant protein secreted by plasmacytoid dendritic cells in systemic sclerosis, both in circulation and in skin. The mean (Â±SD) level of CXCL4 in patients with systemic sclerosis was 25,624Â±2652 pg per milliliter, which was significantly higher than the level in controls (92.5Â±77.9 pg per milliliter) and than the level in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (1346Â±1011 pg per milliliter), ankylosing spondylitis (1368Â±1162 pg per milliliter), or liver fibrosis (1668Â±1263 pg per milliliter). CXCL4 levels correlated with skin and lung fibrosis and with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Among chemokines, only CXCL4 predicted the risk and progression of systemic sclerosis. In vitro, CXCL4 down-regulated expression of transcription factor FLI1, induced markers of endothelial-cell activation, and potentiated responses of toll-like receptors. In vivo, CXCL4 induced the influx of inflammatory cells and skin transcriptome changes, as in systemic sclerosis.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Levels of CXCL4 were elevated in patients with systemic sclerosis and correlated with the presence and progression of complications, such as lung fibrosis and pulmonary arterial hypertension.

"314","A randomized controlled study of mesalamine after acute diverticulitis: results of the DIVA trial.","Journal of clinical gastroenterology","BACKGROUND/AIMS: We evaluated the efficacy of mesalamine (Asacol) in reducing gastrointestinal symptoms after an acute attack of diverticulitis.<br />METHODS: This was a 1-year double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in which patients with computed tomography scan confirmed acute diverticulitis received placebo, mesalamine, or mesalamine+Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 (Align) for 12 weeks and followed for 9 additional months. Efficacy was assessed using a global symptom score (GSS) of 10 symptoms (abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, nausea/vomiting, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, mucus, urgency, painful straining, and dysuria). Patients were required to have a GSSâ‰¥12 at baseline, including an abdominal pain score >2.<br />RESULTS: One hundred seventeen patients (placebo, 41; mesalamine, 40; mesalamine+probiotic, 36) were randomized and treated. GSS decreased in all groups during treatment without a statistically significant difference between mesalamine and placebo, however; scores were consistently lower for mesalamine at all time points. The rate of complete response (GSS=0) was significantly higher with mesalamine than placebo at weeks 6 and 52 (P<0.05), and was particularly high for rectosigmoid symptoms at weeks 6, 12, 26, and 52. Recurrence of diverticulitis was low and comparable across groups. Probiotic in combination with mesalamine did not provide additional efficacy.<br />CONCLUSIONS: In the first US randomized placebo-controlled trial of anti-inflammatory treatment after a documented case of diverticulitis, mesalamine demonstrated a consistent trend in reducing symptoms. Addition of probiotic did not increase mesalamine efficacy. This study supports further investigation into the use of anti-inflammatory agents, such as mesalamine, in the long-term management of diverticulitis.

We evaluated factors affecting the survival of patients with PC from AC after CRS/HIPEC.<br />METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 387 CRS/HIPEC procedures performed between February 1998 and February 2013 identified 202 patients with PC from AC. Tumor histopathology, complete cytoreduction (CC 0-1), Peritoneal Cancer Index (PCI), and lymph node (LN) status were related to overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) using the Kaplan-Meier method.<br />RESULTS: Overall, 129 women (64 %) and 73 men (36 %), mean age 54 years (range 25-81), with a mean follow-up of 36 months were included in the study. Seventy-seven low-grade tumors (disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis [DPAM]; 38 %) and 125 high-grade tumors (peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis [PMCA]; 62 %) were identified. Five- and 10-year OS was 56 % and 47 %, respectively, with PFS of 44 % at 5 and 10 years. Five-year OS in DPAM patients was 83 %, with a 5-year OS significant difference related to CC 0-1 versus CC 2-3 (incomplete cytoreduction) [p = 0.021]. Five-year OS in PMCA patients was 41 %, with a 5-year OS significant difference related to CC 0-1 versus CC 2-3 (p < 0.001), PCI <20 versus PCI â‰¥20 (p = 0.002), and (-)LN versus (+)LN (p < 0.001). Grade III/IV complications were 16 %. No perioperative mortality was reported.<br />CONCLUSION: Positive LN, PMCA histopathology, and PCI â‰¥20 are negative prognostic factors, while CC 0-1 is a positive survival predictor in PC from AC treated with CRS/HIPEC. However, in patients with PMCA and PCI â‰¥20 in whom CC 0-1 was a potential outcome should not be denied CRS/HIPEC.","24986239","2014","12"

Hantavirus infection is a rare cause of acute pancreatitis, which is easy to ignore. There is a need to analyze clinical features of acute pancreatitis caused by Hantavirus.<br />METHODS: This is a retrospective study conducted from May 1, 2006 to May 31, 2012 on patients diagnosed with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome at our hospital. We reviewed these patients medical records, laboratory results and radiologic examinations to determine the prevalence and summarize clinical features of acute pancreatitis in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.<br />RESULTS: A total of 218 patients were diagnosed with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome during the 6-year study period. Only 2.8% (6/218) of the total hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome patients were diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. The first symptom for all six of the patients with acute pancreatitis was fever. All six patients experienced hemorrhage and thrombocytopenia during the disease course, which was different from general acute pancreatitis. In addition, we presented two misdiagnosed clinical cases.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Acute pancreatitis is not a frequent complication in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Clinicians should be alerted to the possibility of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome when acute pancreatitis patients with epidemiological data have high fever before abdominal pain.","24345089","2013",\N
"317","Screening and brief intervention for alcohol and other abuse.","Adolescent medicine: state of the art reviews","Substance use is the most common health risk behavior among adolescents and is one of the greatest threats to their current and future health. Universal screening of adolescents in general medical settings can be instrumental in identifying substance use early, before further problems develop and when BIs are more likely to be effective. Screening in and of itself may have some therapeutic effect. Brief screening tools feasible for use by busy medical offices to quickly and reliably assess adolescent risk for a substance use disorder now are available. A recent study found that a physician-conducted CRAFFT screen interview required an average of 74 seconds to complete, whereas a computer self-administered version took an average of 49 seconds. The CRAFFT and AUDIT tools currently have the most evidence for validity among adolescents, whereas the validity of other widely used tools such as DAST-10, NIDA-modified ASSIST (Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test), and ultra-brief screens (AUDIT-C, single-item screens) has yet to be established for adolescents. Studies are needed to identify effective strategies to promote universal adolescent screening and the use of valid screening tools in general medical settings. One statewide (Massachusetts) study found that although most (86%) primary care physicians seeing adolescents reported screening adolescents for substance use annually, only 1 in 3 reported using a validated tool (the CRAFFT). The remaining physicians reporting using informal screening procedures, their own questionnaire, or the CAGE. Computerization of screening and integration into the electronic health record appear to be promising strategies to promote universal screening and standardized use of valid screening tools. Increasing adolescent screening rates necessitates supporting physicians' ability to respond effectively to the screen results. To that end, recent evidence-informed practice guides from the AAP and NIAAA provide a structured algorithm for specific recommended responses based on level of risk. Adolescents who are at low or moderate risk for a substance use disorder, who constitute most of those seen in general medical settings, may be effectively counseled with a few minutes of brief advice, particularly after being primed with screening, feedback, and education before seeing their physician. High-risk patients (screen-positives) should receive a brief follow-up assessment to determine the appropriate level of care needed and a BI, using MI principles, to enhance motivation for behavioral change and help-seeking. Indications of acute danger or addiction may necessitate breaking confidentiality to protect patient safety and begin RT. Our review shows a small but growing body of research on the effectiveness of opportunistic BIs following screening of adolescents in clinical settings. Studies to date have largely tested brief alcohol-focused MI-based interventions with adolescents in the ED or trauma care settings; however, the number of studies conducted in primary health care settings is increasing. The strongest BI effects found in these studies tend to be related to harm reduction, such as reduction of substance-related driving/riding, alcohol-related injuries, unplanned sex, and other negative consequences of use. Effects on substance use have been more modest and tend to be stronger at shorter (< or = 6 months) rather than longer follow-up (> or = 12 months). However, many of these studies compared BI to active control conditions, which often included elements of BI (eg, assessment, brief advice, informational handouts). Significant reductions in substance use and related harms were also seen in these control groups, likely making detection ofa BI effect more difficult. A few studies have shown initial support for a prevention effect of BI among abstinent adolescents. At the opposite end of the spectrum, little is known about the effects of BI for adolescents with dependence and needing RT because of a lack of studies. Other areas needing additional research are the effect of BI on adolescent drug use, particularly on use of drugs other than cannabis; the mediators and moderators of BI effects; ways to reinforce and sustain effects over time; and how best to increase SBI implementation in general medical settings and to effectively train physicians. The effect of efforts such as the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration-funded physician residency SBIRT training programs remain to be determined. There has been increasing investigation into the potential of interactive computer technologies to aid SBIRT delivery to adolescents and young adults. A more detailed review of this area of research is beyond the scope of this article, but computer technology is proving to be an acceptable and effective tool in the delivery of BIs to young people, both as physician \"extenders\" in clinical settings and in the form of stand-alone self-guided programs.","25022191","2014","4"
"318","Decision making in borderline ovarian tumors: report of a rare case of mesosigma psammocarcinoma.","Annali italiani di chirurgia","Psammocarcinoma is a rare variant of serous carcinoma arising either from ovary or peritoneum, characterized by massive psammoma body formation, low-grade of cytologic differentiation and invasiveness. Its clinical behavior is similar to the serous borderline tumors, whose prognosis is significantly better compared to invasive forms, with a 5-year survival in stage I greater than 95%. A typical feature of borderline ovary tumors is the presence, in more than 30% of cases, of borderline peritoneal implants similar to primary ovarian cancer or of invasive forms. We report a case of a 44-years-old woman who referred to our clinic for mesosigmoid mass , accidentally discovered by ultrasonography. Sigmoidectomy with fertility sparing surgery was performed in september 2010. The mass was hystologically characterized by many psammoma bodies and low grade cytological features with diagnosis of psammocarcinoma of mesosigma. One year after the primary surgery, the patient showed with left adnexial mass; optimal debulking surgery was performed including omentectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy and appendicectomy. The patient did not receive any adjuvant chemotherapy and to date she is alive and with no evidence of disease. The conclusion is that psammocarcinoma is a very rare tumor that behaves less aggressively than typical serous carcinoma, the mainstay of treatment is surgical debulking , with fertility sparing surgery as possible option in young patients with ovaries macroscopically free of disease.","23995281","2013",\N

"321","Effect of a preoperative gabapentin on postoperative analgesia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease following major bowel surgery: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","Pain practice : the official journal of World Institute of Pain","BACKGROUND: Postoperative pain management for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can be challenging. These patients have a high tolerance to pain medication, and relative contraindications to the use of epidural analgesia, limiting the pain management options. We evaluated the effect of a single preoperative gabapentin dose on opioid consumption for patients with IBD undergoing abdominal surgery. Secondary outcomes were postoperative pain scores, opioid-related side effects, and patient's length of hospital stay.<br />METHODS: Following Research Ethics Board approval and informed written consent, patients were randomly allocated into 2 groups receiving either 600 mg of oral gabapentin or placebo 1 hour before the surgery. A blinded anesthesiologist recorded pain scores at rest and movement twice daily for 2 postoperative days. Also recorded were opioid consumption, time of return of bowel function, time to discharge, and opioid-related side effects on the opioid-related symptom distress scale (ORSDS).<br />RESULTS: Seventy-two patients completed the study. The difference in opioid consumption (P = 0.4169) and pain scores measured at rest and movement on all 4 postoperative visits was not statistically significant. There was no significant difference between gabapentin and placebo on all the 11 symptoms reported on the ORSDS. There was a slight increase in length of hospital stay in the placebo group, but the return of bowel function was similar between the groups.<br />CONCLUSIONS: This study examined the effect of a single preoperative administration of gabapentin in patients with IBD undergoing major bowel surgery. Our results suggest a single preoperative oral dose of gabapentin 600 mg does not reduce postoperative pain scores, opioid consumption, or opioid-related side effects.","23560500","2014","2"

Providers believed that retail clinics were a business threat (80%) and disrupted continuity of chronic disease management (54%). Few (20%) agreed that retail clinics provided care within recommended clinical guidelines. Most (91%) reported that they provided additional care after a retail clinic visit (median 1-2 times per week), and 37% felt this resulted from suboptimal care at retail clinics \"most or all of the time.\" Few (15%) reported being notified by the retail clinic within 24 hours of a patient visit. Those reporting prompt communication were less likely to report suboptimal retail clinic care (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.10-0.42) or disruption in continuity of care (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15-0.71). Thirty-six percent reported changes to office practice to compete with retail clinics (most commonly adjusting or extending office hours), and change was more likely if retail clinics were perceived as a threat (OR 3.70, 95% CI 1.56-8.76); 30% planned to make changes in the near future.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Based on the perceived business threat, pediatric providers are making changes to their practice to compete with retail clinics. Improved communication between the clinic and providers may improve collaboration.","23810720","2013","11"

One rare condition that can mimic acute appendicitis is a nematode infection of the bowel. There have been few reported cases of nematode infection within the appendix and none that have been accompanied by intra-operative pictures.<br />PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 16-year-old female presented with a 12h history of right iliac fossa pain and mild pyrexia. Bloods showed a neutrophilia and normal C-reactive protein. Laparoscopy was performed which revealed a non-inflamed appendix. The appendix was dissected and a live nematode was visualised exiting the base of the appendix. Anti-helminthics were given and the infection resolved.<br />DISCUSSION: Nematode infection is most commonly seen in Africa, Asia and South America. When seen within the United Kingdom (UK), it is seen most commonly within high-risk populations. Testing for these infections is not routine within the UK and when they are performed, the results take a considerable amount of time to return. These tests should be considered within high-risk populations so that unnecessary surgery can be avoided.<br />CONCLUSION: This case highlights the importance of considering rare causes of right iliac fossa pain including nematode infection in a young patient. The case highlights this by giving intra-operative pictures of live nematodes upon dissection of the appendix.","25024022","2014",\N

"327","Secreted mucins in pseudomyxoma peritonei: pathophysiological significance and potential therapeutic prospects.","Orphanet journal of rare diseases","Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP, ORPHA26790) is a clinical syndrome characterized by progressive dissemination of mucinous tumors and mucinous ascites in the abdomen and pelvis. PMP is a rare disease with an estimated incidence of 1-2 out of a million. Clinically, PMP usually presents with a variety of unspecific signs and symptoms, including abdominal pain and distention, ascites or even bowel obstruction. It is also diagnosed incidentally at surgical or non-surgical investigations of the abdominopelvic viscera. PMP is a neoplastic disease originating from a primary mucinous tumor of the appendix with a distinctive pattern of the peritoneal spread. Computed tomography and histopathology are the most reliable diagnostic modalities. The differential diagnosis of the disease includes secondary peritoneal carcinomatoses and some rare peritoneal conditions. Optimal elimination of mucin and the mucin-secreting tumor comprises the current standard of care for PMP offered in specialized centers as visceral resections and peritonectomy combined with intraperitoneal chemotherapy. This multidisciplinary approach has reportedly provided a median survival rate of 16.3 years, a median progression-free survival rate of 8.2 years and 10- and 15-year survival rates of 63% and 59%, respectively. Despite its indolent, bland nature as a neoplasm, PMP is a debilitating condition that severely impacts quality of life. It tends to be diagnosed at advanced stages and frequently recurs after treatment. Being ignored in research, however, PMP remains a challenging, enigmatic entity. Clinicopathological features of the PMP syndrome and its morbid complications closely correspond with the multifocal distribution of the secreted mucin collections and mucin-secreting implants. Novel strategies are thus required to facilitate macroscopic, as well as microscopic, elimination of mucin and its source as the key components of the disease. In this regard, MUC2, MUC5AC and MUC5B have been found as the secreted mucins of relevance in PMP. Development of mucin-targeted therapies could be a promising avenue for future research which is addressed in this article.","24886459","2014",\N
"328","Tidal Venuses: triggering a climate catastrophe via tidal heating.","Astrobiology","Traditionally, stellar radiation has been the only heat source considered capable of determining global climate on long timescales. Here, we show that terrestrial exoplanets orbiting low-mass stars may be tidally heated at high-enough levels to induce a runaway greenhouse for a long-enough duration for all the hydrogen to escape. Without hydrogen, the planet no longer has water and cannot support life. We call these planets \"Tidal Venuses\" and the phenomenon a \"tidal greenhouse.\" Tidal effects also circularize the orbit, which decreases tidal heating. Hence, some planets may form with large eccentricity, with its accompanying large tidal heating, and lose their water, but eventually settle into nearly circular orbits (i.e., with negligible tidal heating) in the habitable zone (HZ). However, these planets are not habitable, as past tidal heating desiccated them, and hence should not be ranked highly for detailed follow-up observations aimed at detecting biosignatures. We simulated the evolution of hypothetical planetary systems in a quasi-continuous parameter distribution and found that we could constrain the history of the system by statistical arguments. Planets orbiting stars with masses<0.3 MSun may be in danger of desiccation via tidal heating. We have applied these concepts to Gl 667C c, a âˆ¼4.5 MEarth planet orbiting a 0.3 MSun star at 0.12 AU. We found that it probably did not lose its water via tidal heating, as orbital stability is unlikely for the high eccentricities required for the tidal greenhouse. As the inner edge of the HZ is defined by the onset of a runaway or moist greenhouse powered by radiation, our results represent a fundamental revision to the HZ for noncircular orbits. In the appendices we review (a) the moist and runaway greenhouses, (b) hydrogen escape, (c) stellar mass-radius and mass-luminosity relations, (d) terrestrial planet mass-radius relations, and (e) linear tidal theories.","23537135","2013","3"

"330","Laparoscopy is safe among patients with congestive heart failure undergoing general surgery procedures.","Surgery","BACKGROUND: Over the past 2 decades, laparoscopy has been established as a superior technique in many general surgery procedures. Few studies, however, have examined the impact of the use of a laparoscopic approach in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF). Because pneumoperitoneum has known effects on cardiopulmonary physiology, patients with CHF may be at increased risk. This study examines current trends in approaches to patients with CHF and effects on perioperative outcomes.<br />METHODS: The 2005-2011 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Participant User File was used to identify patients who underwent the following general surgery procedures: Appendectomy, segmental colectomy, small bowel resection, ventral hernia repair, and splenectomy. Included for analysis were those with newly diagnosed CHF or chronic CHF with new signs or symptoms. Trends of use of laparoscopy were assessed across procedure types. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality. The independent effect of laparoscopy in CHF was estimated with a multiple logistic regression model.<br />RESULTS: A total of 265,198 patients were included for analysis, of whom 2,219 were identified as having new or recently worsened CHF. Of these patients, there were 1,300 (58.6%) colectomies, 486 (21.9%) small bowel resections, 216 (9.7%) ventral hernia repairs, 141 (6.4%) appendectomies, and 76 (3.4%) splenectomies. Laparoscopy was used less frequently in patients with CHF compared with their non-CHF counterparts, particularly for nonelective procedures. Baseline characteristics were similar for laparoscopy versus open procedures with the notable exception of urgent/emergent case status (36.4% vs 71.3%; P < .001). After multivariable adjustment, laparoscopy seemed to have a protective effect against mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 0.45; P = .04), but no differences in other secondary endpoints.<br />CONCLUSION: For patients with CHF, an open operative approach seems to be utilized more frequently in general surgery procedures, particularly in urgent/emergent cases. Despite these patterns and apparent preferences, laparoscopy seems to offer a safe alternative in appropriately selected patients. Because morbidity and mortality were considerable regardless of approach, further understanding of appropriate management in this population is necessary.","24947641","2014","8"

Two consecutive total body scans were performed on each participant with re-positioning between scans. There was excellent agreement between consecutive scans for measurements of both fat and lean appendicular and trunk composition (R(2)=0.99). Precision for body composition at all regions was less than 2% coefficient of variation (CV). Precision for bilateral appendicular body composition was less than 4% CV for the arms and less than 2.5% CV for the legs.

Reassessed at 24 hours, we decide surgery with a presumptive diagnosis of intestinal obstruction, intussusception. In surgery, we identified a transverse colon tumor (with colo-colonic intussusception) and 10cm of colon was resected and meso tumor: TT anastomosis was performed in transverse colon. The lesion was a tumor of the middle region of the transverse colon, proliferative fibroid appearance, which almost completely obstructed the intestinal lumen, measuring about 7x5cm. The study of pathology with immunohistochemistry indicated that the tumor corresponded to leiomyosarcoma of the colon. Was discharged in good condition. The rarity of this type of malignancy and this type of presentation led us to make this report.","24108379",\N,\N
"337","Significance of urinary tract involvement in patients treated with cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).","Annals of surgical oncology","BACKGROUND: Urinary tract involvement in patients with peritoneal surface disease treated with cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) often requires complex urologic resections and reconstruction to achieve optimal cytoreduction. The impact of these combined procedures on surgical outcomes is not well defined.<br />METHODS: A prospective database of CRS/HIPEC procedures was analyzed retrospectively. Type of malignancy, performance status, resection status, hospital and intensive care unit stay, morbidity, mortality, and overall survival were reviewed.<br />RESULTS: A total of 864 patients underwent 933 CRS/HIPEC procedures, while 64 % (550) had preoperative ureteral stent placement. A total of 7.3 % had an additional urologic procedure without an increase in 30-day (p = 0.4) or 90-day (p = 1.0) mortality. Urologic procedures correlated with increased length of operating time (p < 0.001), blood loss (p < 0.001), and length of hospitalization (p = 0.003), yet were not associated with increased overall 30-day major morbidity (grade III/IV, p = 0.14). In multivariate analysis, independent predictors of additional urologic procedures were prior surgical score (p < 0.001), number of resected organs (p = 0.001), and low anterior resection (p = 0.03). Long-term survival was not statistically different between patients with and without urologic resection for low-grade appendiceal primary lesions (p = 0.23), high-grade appendiceal primary lesions (p = 0.40), or colorectal primary lesions (p = 0.14).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Urinary tract involvement in patients with peritoneal surface disease does not increase overall surgical morbidity. Patients with urologic procedures demonstrate survival patterns with meaningful prolongation of life. Urologic involvement should not be considered a contraindication for CRS/HIPEC in patients with resectable peritoneal surface disease.","24217789","2014","3"

A 48-year-old nulliparous presented with a two-day history of abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, and menorrhagia. Within eight hours, her distress level increased. Computed tomography (CT) scanning of the abdomen showed a large, 31 x 25 cm solid-cystic lesion. An emergency laparotomy was indicated. Surgery revealed approximately 2,000 cc of blood and a 30 cm degenerated uterine fibroid with a fundal rupture, cystic, and solid components extending to the lower pole of the liver. Pathology results noted mild nuclear atypia, six mitoses per ten high-power fields (hpf) and necrosis spread that was not coagulative with a STUMP diagnosis. STUMP presents a problematic group of uterine smooth muscle tumors for any clinician. In addition, STUMP can rarely cause acute complications like a rupture.

Military-medical and pharmaceutical review","INTRODUCTION: Granulomatosis Wegener is anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs)-associated systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology. It is manifested as granulomatous necrotizing inflammation of the upper and lower parts of the respiratory tract, glomerulonephritis and systemic vasculitis involving most frequently the skin and oral mucous membrane. Sera markers of this disease are c-ANCA and pANCA.<br />CASE REPORT: We presented a female patient aged 52 years with purpuric spots that had appeared on the lower legs ten months before admission to our hospital. The disease ran an aggressive course, and a month before admission hemorrhagic bullae, skin ulcers, hoarseness, dyspnea, generalized arthralgia, fatigue and fever had rapidly developed. Histopathological examination of a skin sample revealed necrotizing vasculitis, so that sera markers concentrations were elevated (c-ANCA, p-ANCA). There was a perforation of the nasal septum found on rhinoscopy. During hospitalization acute abdominal pain occurred, a possible tumor in the small intestine and possible granulomas in the liver were seen by multislice computed tomography (MSCT) examination, with normal findings on the lungs and kidneys. The treatment started with methylprednisolone: 500 mg/d i.v. infusion for consecutive 3 days, then 60 mg/d. On exploratory laparotomy small bowel perforation and diffuse peritonitis were found. Unstable in the postoperative period, the patient died on the day 12 of hospitalization.<br />CONCLUSION: The reported patient was with fulminant Wegener's granulomatosis, dominantly with skin changes and with gastrointestinal manifestation. This case accents the need for rapid systemic clinical evaluation in a severely ill patient with unclear diagnosis.","24266321","2013","9"

"343","Impact of whole-body electromyostimulation on body composition in elderly women at risk for sarcopenia: the Training and ElectroStimulation Trial (TEST-III).","Age (Dordrecht, Netherlands)","Most studies have confirmed the positive impact of resistance training on muscle mass and functional capacity in aging adults. However, due to physical limitation or a simple aversion against regular exercise, the majority of elderly subjects do not reach the exercise doses recommended for impacting strength or muscle mass. This led us to evaluate the effect of whole-body electromyostimulation (WB-EMS), a novel, time-efficient and smooth training technology, on body composition with special regard to sarcopenia. Seventy-six lean, non-sportive women (75 Â± 4 years) were randomly assigned to either a WB-EMS group (WB-EMS, n = 38) that performed 18 min of WB-EMS (bipolar, 85 Hz) 3 sessions in 14 days (1.5 sessions/week) or a semi-active control group (aCG, n = 38). Body composition was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and maximum strength was evaluated using isometric techniques for trunk and legs. After 54 weeks of intervention, significant inter-group differences were determined for appendicular skeletal muscle mass (WB-EMS, 0.4 Â± 2.2 % vs. aCG, -1.5 Â± 3.1 %; p = 0.009), lean body mass (WB-EMS, 0.8 Â± 1.8 % vs. aCG, -0.8 Â± 2.7 %; p = 0.008) and maximum isometric strength (leg extensors, 9.8 Â± 12.9 % vs. 0.2 Â± 10.4 %; p = 0.003; trunk extensors, 10.1 Â± 12.7 vs. -1.6 Â± 8.6 %; p = 0.001). Although borderline significant for abdominal fat mass (WB-EMS, -2.9 Â± 8.3 vs. aCG, 1.5 Â± 10.7 %; p = 0.069), differences did not reach statistically significant levels for body fat parameters. Considering the clinical effectiveness for impacting sarcopenia and the good acceptance of this technology by this non-sportive cohort of elderly women, we conclude that for elderly subjects unable or unwilling to perform dynamic strength exercises, electromyostimulation may be a less off-putting alternative to maintain lean body mass and strength.","23949160","2014","2"

This study hypothesizes that performance of appendicostomy/cecostomy prior to starting school (<6 years) would improve functional stooling and quality of life (QOL).<br />METHODS: Patients who underwent appendicostomy/cecostomy for bowel management between 2003 and 2013 were retrospectively identified. Families were prospectively surveyed regarding current stooling habits (17 items) and a (7 item) pediatric QOL survey. Lower stooling survey scores represent better bowel control. Higher QOL scores indicated better quality. The primary outcome was to correlate age of appendicostomy/cecostomy to QOL score. Statistics were performed using paired, unpaired t tests, and Chi-square. p Values â‰¤0.05 were considered significant.<br />RESULTS: 35 patients underwent placement of appendicostomy/cecostomy. Fourteen (40%) patients/families were prospectively contacted (<6, n = 6; >6, n = 8). Stooling scores (15.17 Â± 1.35 vs. 22.25 Â± 1.70; for <6 vs. >6 years old, p = 0.009) and continence scores (6.33 Â± 1.45 vs. 11.13 Â± 1.64; p = 0.06), at time of contacting families, were significantly better in those undergoing appendicostomy/cecostomy in the <6 group. Pre-procedure QOL scores for the two groups were similar (p = 0.89). Post-procedure QOL significantly increased to the good subcategory for both age groups; however improvement was significantly better in the <6 age group vs. â‰¥6 group: 6.33 Â± 0.92 vs. 3.13 Â± 0.91 points (p = 0.03).

"345","Pathologic rupture of the spleen in a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia and leukostasis.","Revista brasileira de hematologia e hemoterapia","Rupture of the spleen can be classified as spontaneous, traumatic, or pathologic. Pathologic rupture has been reported in infectious diseases such as infectious mononucleosis, and hematologic malignancies such as acute and chronic leukemias. Splenomegaly is considered the most relevant factor that predisposes to splenic rupture. A 66-year-old man with acute myeloid leukemia evolved from an unclassified myeloproliferative neoplasm, complaining of fatigue and mild upper left abdominal pain. He was pale and presented fever and tachypnea. Laboratory analyses showed hemoglobin 8.3g/dL, white blood cell count 278Ã—10(9)/L, platelet count 367Ã—10(9)/L, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ratio 2.10, and international normalized ratio (INR) 1.60. A blood smear showed 62% of myeloblasts. The immunophenotype of the blasts was positive for CD117, HLA-DR, CD13, CD56, CD64, CD11c and CD14. Lactate dehydrogenase was 2384U/L and creatinine 2.4mg/dL (normal range: 0.7-1.6mg/dL). Two sessions of leukapheresis were performed. At the end of the second session, the patient presented hemodynamic instability that culminated in circulatory shock and death. The post-mortem examination revealed infiltration of the vessels of the lungs, heart, and liver, and massive infiltration of the spleen by leukemic blasts. Blood volume in the peritoneal cavity was 500mL. Acute leukemia is a rare cause of splenic rupture. Male gender, old age and splenomegaly are factors associated with this condition. As the patient had leukostasis, we hypothesize that this, associated with other factors such as lung and heart leukemic infiltration, had a role in inducing splenic rupture. Finally, we do not believe that leukapheresis in itself contributed to splenic rupture, as it is essentially atraumatic.","25031169",\N,\N

"347","Clinicopathological analysis and prognostic factors of 11 patients with primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the small intestine in a single institute.","Oncology letters","The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is the most common extranodal site of involvement in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Primary GI NHL is frequently discussed in survival analyses. Primary intestinal NHL is significantly different from primary gastric NHL with regard to its clinical features, pathological subtype, treatment and prognosis. The small intestine is involved in lymphoma less often than the large intestine. The present study aimed to analyze the clinical and pathological characteristics of primary NHL of the small intestine and its prognostic factors. A retrospective analysis was performed on clinical data from 313 cases of NHL that occurred between 1995 and 2008 in the Tri-Service General Hospital (National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan). Among these cases, 11 cases of primary NHL of the small intestine were identified. A Cox model was used to perform the multivariate analysis. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for the survival analysis. From the 11 patients with primary NHL of the small intestine, seven patients were male (63.6%) and four patients were female (36.3%). Furthermore, nine patients (81.8%) were diagnosed with B-cell lymphoma, of which five (45.5%) were also diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBL). Abdominal pain and/or distention were present in six (54.5%) of the patients and jejunum involvement was also observed in six (54.5%) of the 11 patients. The mean overall survival (OS) time of the 11 patients was 27.2 months and the four-year survival rate was 36.3%. The mean OS time in the patients with jejunum involvement was shorter than in those without jejunum involvement (16.9 vs. 39.6 months), although this difference was not significant (P=0.657). Surgical treatment was performed on four of the six patients with jejunum involvement due to an acute abdomen or perforation-related peritonitis. The results of the present study indicate that DLBL is the most common subtype of primary lymphoma of the small intestine, and that the site involved in NHL may affect the potential for surgery in patients with intestinal lymphoma. Furthermore, patients with primary lymphoma of the small intestine have been found to have a poor outcome compared with those with lymphoma in other regions of the GI tract. In the present study, a similar trend was observed, however, the sizes of the subgroups of primary lymphoma of the small intestine were too small for individual analysis.","25013511","2014","8"

To compare narcotic versus nonnarcotic outpatient oral pain management after pediatric laparoscopic appendectomy. Methods. In a prospective study from July 1, 2010, to March 30, 2011, children undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy on a rapid discharge protocol were treated with either nonnarcotic or narcotic postoperative oral analgesia. Two surgeons in a four-person faculty group employed the nonnarcotic regimen, while the other two used narcotics. Days of medication use, time needed for return to normal activity, and satisfaction rate with the pain control method were collected. Student's t-test was used for statistical analysis. Results. A total of 207 consecutive children underwent appendectomy for acute, nonperforated appendicitis or planned interval appendectomy. The age and time to discharge were equivalent between the nonnarcotic (n = 104) and narcotic (n = 103) groups. Both had an equivalent number of medication days and similar times of return to normal activity. Ninety-seven percent of the parents of children in the nonnarcotic group stated that the pain was controlled by the prescribed medication, compared to 90 percent in the narcotic group (P = 0.049). Conclusion. This study indicates that after non-complicated pediatric laparoscopic appendectomy, nonnarcotic is equivalent to narcoticbased therapy for outpatient oral analgesia, with higher parental satisfaction.","24834350","2014",\N

No one defining symptom exists for stercoral colitis; it may present asymptomatically or with vague symptoms. Diagnostic delay may result in perforation of the colon resulting in complications, even death. Moreover, stercoral perforation of the colon can also present with localized left lower quadrant abdominal pain masquerading as diverticulitis. Diverticular diseases and stercoral colitis share similar pathophysiology; furthermore, they may coexist, further complicating the diagnostic dilemma. The ability to decide the cause of perforation in a patient with both stercoral colitis and diverticulosis has not been discussed. We, therefore, report this case of stercoral perforation in a patient with diverticulosis and include a discussion of the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and a review of helpful diagnostic clues for a rapid differentiation to allow for accurate diagnosis and treatment.","24596650","2014",\N

"359","Severe hemorrhagic colitis in a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia in the blastic phase after dasatinib use.","World journal of gastrointestinal pathophysiology","Dasatinib is a second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in patients with imatinib resistant or intolerant chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute leukemia. Gastrointestinal bleeding may occur in up to 7% of patients using dasatinib, although, severe dasatinib-related acute colitis had rarely been reported. Here, we present the case of a 36-year-old female who progressed to acute myeloid leukemia after fourteen months of receiving imatinib for CML in the chronic phase and was treated with a dasatinib-containing chemotherapy regimen. On day 34 of treatment, the patient developed moderate abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea with mucous. Analyses of stool specimens were negative for parasites, Clostridium difficile, and other pathogenic bacteria. The cytomegalovirus pp65 antigen was negative in her blood leukocytes. A colonoscopy revealed acute colitis, and a mucosal biopsy showed nonspecific colitis. The patient was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, bowel rest and hydration, and dasatinib treatment was stopped. Her bloody diarrhea improved within 72 h. After confirming cytological remission, the patient received initial course of consolidation, and dasatinib treatment was reinstated. However, hemorrhagic colitis recurred. After discontinuing dasatinib, herhemorrhagic colitis drastically improved and did not recur following the administration of nilotinib. The characteristics of our patient suggest that dasatinib treatment can lead to hemorrhagic colitis, which typically resolves after discontinuation of the drug.","23946889","2013","8"
"360","Presentations of acute coronary syndrome related to coronary lesion morphologies as assessed by intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography.","International journal of cardiology","BACKGROUND: Pathologically, the lesions responsible for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are ruptures of vulnerable plaques (and occasionally fibrous-cap erosions or calcified nodules) with a superimposed thrombosis. We aimed to clarify the clinical presentations related to the morphologies of coronary lesions of ACS using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT).<br />METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy-five culprit lesions of ACS patients were clearly assessed with IVUS and OCT. Patients were classified into two groups based on the presence or absence of a rupture of a culprit plaque as identified by OCT. Clinical characteristics and lesion morphologies were compared between the two groups. Waist circumference was significantly greater (p<0.02) and prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (MS) higher (p=0.0011) in the rupture group. The prevalence of prodromal angina was higher in patients without plaque ruptures (p<0.0001). Using multivariate analysis, the MS and prodromal angina were independent predictors of rupture of a culprit coronary plaque (odds ratio (OR): 27.30, p<0.003 and OR: 0.04, p=0.0004, respectively). Among the components of the MS, the prevalence of abdominal obesity was a significant independent predictor of rupture of a culprit plaque (OR: 4.24, p<0.02).<br />CONCLUSIONS: There are two presentations related to the coronary lesion morphologies of ACS: we should understand these aspects of ACS.","21962801","2013","5"
"361","Intraperitoneal chemotherapy for peritoneal surface malignancy: experience with 1,000 patients.","Journal of the American College of Surgeons","BACKGROUND: Peritoneal dissemination of abdominal malignancy (carcinomatosis) has a clinical course marked by bowel obstruction and death; it traditionally does not respond well to systemic therapy and has been approached with nihilism. To treat carcinomatosis, we use cytoreductive surgery (CS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).<br />METHODS: A prospective database of patients has been maintained since 1992. Patients with biopsy-proven peritoneal surface disease were uniformly evaluated for, and treated with, CS and HIPEC. Patient demographics, performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group), resection status, and peritoneal surface disease were classified according to primary site. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. The experience was divided into quintiles and outcomes compared.<br />RESULTS: Between 1991 and 2013, a total of 1,000 patients underwent 1,097 HIPEC procedures. Mean age was 52.9 years and 53.1% were female. Primary tumor site was appendix in 472 (47.2%), colorectal in 248 (24.8%), mesothelioma in 72 (7.2%), ovary in 69 (6.9%), gastric in 46 (4.6%), and other in 97 (9.7%). Thirty-day mortality rate was 3.8% and median hospital stay was 8 days. Median overall survival was 29.4 months, with a 5-year survival rate of 32.5%. Factors correlating with improved survival on univariate and multivariate analysis (p â‰¤ 0.0001 for each) were preoperative performance status, primary tumor type, resection status, and experience quintile (p = 0.04). For the 5 quintiles, the 1- and 5-year survival rates, as well as the complete cytoreduction score (R0, R1, R2a) have increased, and transfusions, stoma creations, and complications have all decreased significantly (p < .001 for all).<br />CONCLUSIONS: This largest reported single-center experience with CS and HIPEC demonstrates that prognostic factors include primary site, performance status, completeness of resection, and institutional experience. The data show that outcomes have improved over time, with more complete cytoreduction and fewer serious complications, transfusions, and stomas. This was due to better patient selection and increased operative experience. Cytoreductive surgery with HIPEC represents a substantial improvement in outcomes compared with historical series, and shows that meaningful long-term survival is possible for selected carcinomatosis patients. Multi-institutional cooperative trials are needed to refine the use of CS and HIPEC.","24491244","2014","4"

"363","Safety assessment of resident grade and supervision level during emergency appendectomy: analysis of a multicenter, prospective study.","Surgery","BACKGROUND: Resident surgeons have been identified as a risk factor for worse outcome after appendectomy. The context of grade of resident and impact of supervision require further investigation. The objective of this study was to determine whether grade and supervision level of resident-performed appendectomy affects patient outcome.<br />METHODS: A multicenter, prospective cohort study was performed for consecutive patients undergoing appendectomy during May and June 2013. The primary endpoint for this analysis was the 30-day adverse event rate. Supervision was defined as resident-performed appendectomy with an attending scrubbed. Multivariable binary logistic regression was used to take into account case mix and produce adjusted odds ratios (OR).<br />RESULTS: From 2,867 appendectomies, 87% were performed by residents, and 72% were performed unsupervised. Residents operated on significantly younger patients with lower American Society of Anesthesiologists scores. Although wound infection rates were similar between attendings, and senior and junior residents (4.1%, 3.8%, 3.4% respectively; P = .486), pelvic abscess rate was greater for attendings (5.2%, 2.7%, 2.4%; P = .045). In adjusted models, supervised senior, supervised junior, and unsupervised junior residents showed no difference in 30-day adverse event rates compared with attendings (OR, 1.07 [P = .834], 0.93 [P = .773], and 0.83 [P = .264] respectively); unsupervised senior residents had a lesser rate of adverse events (OR, 0.71; P = .045). All resident groups showed no difference for rates of histopathologically normal appendectomy compared with attendings.<br />CONCLUSION: Resident-performed appendectomy does not worsen patient outcomes. These findings support independent resident operating rights for selected cases. The system relies on mutual credentialing of competency between residents and supervising attendings.","24882763","2014","7"

We evaluated the postoperative analgesic efficacy of ultrasound-guided TAP block using 20 mL of 0.5% levobupivacaine in patients undergoing open appendectomy.<br />METHODS: Forty-four patients undergoing appendectomy were assigned either to undergo a right sided-TAP block (group I, n = 22), or to receive standard care (group II, n = 22). All patients received standard anesthetics, and the TAP block group received ultrasound-guided right side TAP block using 20 mL of 0.5% levobupivacaine after induction of anesthesia. All patients received acetaminophen, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug as required during the 48 postoperative hours. Each patients was assessed for time to first rescue analgesia, verbal numerical rating pain scores (VNRS), number of rescue analgesic demands, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and drowsiness by a blinded investigator at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours postoperatively.<br />RESULTS: The TAP block group with levobupivacaine compared to the control group reduced VNRS significantly up to 12 hours postoperatively. There were no significant differences in time to first analgesia, number of rescue analgesics demands, nausea, vomiting, pruritus and drowsiness between the groups. There were no complications attributable to the TAP block.<br />CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided TAP block using 20 mL of 0.5% levobupivacaine provided effective postoperative analgesia during the 12 postoperative hours after an open appendectomy.","24020022","2013","9"

We suspected a genetic cause because the disorder presented in early childhood.<br />METHODS: We performed whole-exome sequencing in the initial three patients and their unaffected parents and candidate-gene sequencing in three patients with a similar phenotype, as well as two young siblings with polyarteritis nodosa and one patient with small-vessel vasculitis. Enzyme assays, immunoblotting, immunohistochemical testing, flow cytometry, and cytokine profiling were performed on samples from the patients. To study protein function, we used morpholino-mediated knockdowns in zebrafish and short hairpin RNA knockdowns in U937 cells cultured with human dermal endothelial cells.<br />RESULTS: All nine patients carried recessively inherited mutations in CECR1 (cat eye syndrome chromosome region, candidate 1), encoding adenosine deaminase 2 (ADA2), that were predicted to be deleterious; these mutations were rare or absent in healthy controls. Six patients were compound heterozygous for eight CECR1 mutations, whereas the three patients with polyarteritis nodosa or small-vessel vasculitis were homozygous for the p.Gly47Arg mutation. Patients had a marked reduction in the levels of ADA2 and ADA2-specific enzyme activity in the blood. Skin, liver, and brain biopsies revealed vasculopathic changes characterized by compromised endothelial integrity, endothelial cellular activation, and inflammation. Knockdown of a zebrafish ADA2 homologue caused intracranial hemorrhages and neutropenia - phenotypes that were prevented by coinjection with nonmutated (but not with mutated) human CECR1. Monocytes from patients induced damage in cocultured endothelial-cell layers.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Loss-of-function mutations in CECR1 were associated with a spectrum of vascular and inflammatory phenotypes, ranging from early-onset recurrent stroke to systemic vasculopathy or vasculitis.

"366","Effects of fluoride and cadmium co-exposure on bone in male rats.","Biological trace element research","Although cadmium (Cd) and fluoride may both have adverse effects on bone, most studies focus on a single agent. In this study, we investigated the effects of cadmium and fluoride on bone at a relative low level. Sprague-Dawley male rats were assigned randomly into four groups which were given sodium chloride, cadmium (50mg/L), and fluoride (20mg/L) alone, or in combination via drinking water. At the 12th week, urine, blood, and bone tissues were collected for biomarker assay, biomechanical assay, and histological assay. Cadmium had significantly adverse effects on bone mineral density, bone biomechanical property, and bone microstructure. Fluoride slightly increased vertebral bone mineral density but negatively affected bone biomechanical property and bone microstructure. Fluoride could reverse the decrease of vertebral bone mineral density caused by cadmium but could not improve the damage of bone biomechanical property and microstructure caused by cadmium. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b levels in rats treated with cadmium and fluoride or in combination were 1-2.5 folds higher than the control. Our data suggest that low level of fluoride could reverse the decrease of vertebral bone mineral density caused by cadmium exposure but has no influence on appendicular skeleton damage caused by cadmium.","23868496","2013","9"

We examined the frequency and variety of inpatient pediatric surgical procedures in the United States by hospital type and geographic region using a nationally representative sample.<br />METHODS: The 2009 Kids' Inpatient Database for patients <18 years old was used to calculate surgical frequencies by using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, (ICD-9-CM) codes. We performed stratified analysis by hospital type (free-standing children's hospital, children's unit within an adult hospital, and general hospital) and geographic region (South, West, Midwest, Northeast) to compare frequencies of surgical procedures.<br />RESULTS: A total of 216â€‰081 procedures were projected for 2009 with the top 20 procedures accounting for >90% of cases. As many as 40% of all pediatric inpatient surgical procedures are being performed in adult general hospitals. Infrequent complex low-volume neonatal surgical procedures (pullthrough for Hirschsprung disease, surgery for malrotation, esophageal atresia repair, and diaphragmatic hernia repair) were 6.8 to 16 times more likely to occur in a children's hospital. Significant regional variation in procedure frequency rates occurred for appendectomy and cholecystectomy.<br />CONCLUSIONS: This report is the first to characterize pediatric surgical inpatient volume in the United States. Such data may influence the distribution of pediatric surgeons, number of trainees, and training curricula for pediatric surgeons, pediatricians, general surgeons and other surgical specialists who might operate on children. In addition, it raises the question of whether complex pediatric surgical procedures should preferably be performed at dedicated high volume children's hospitals.","24276846","2013","12"

In countries where abortions are restricted women have to resort to clandestine interventions to have an unwanted pregnancy terminated. The study was conducted to find out the prevalence of septic induced abortion and the associated morbidity and mortality and to highlight the measures to reduce it.<br />METHODS: This cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out in Obs/Gyn B Unit, Ayub Teaching Hospital, Abbottabad from January 2007 to December 2011. During this period all the patients presenting with pyrexia lower abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, acute abdomen, septic or hypovolaemic shock after undergoing some sort of intervention for abortion outside the hospital were included. After thorough history, examination and detailed investigations including high vaginal and endocervical swabs for culture and sensitivity and pelvic ultrasound supportive management was given followed by antibiotics, surgical evacuation of uterus/ major laparotomy in collaboration with surgeon as required. Patients with DIC or multiple system involvement were managed in High Dependency Unit (HDU) by multidisciplinary team.<br />RESULTS: During the study period out of a total 6,906 admissions 968 presented with spontaneous abortion. There were 110 cases (11.36%) of unsafe abortion, 56.4% presented with vaginal discharge, 34.5% with vaginal bleeding, 21.8% with acute abdomen, while 18.9% in shock and 6.8% with DIC.

This 8th event in 2012 (Reunion island, overseas department of France in the Indian Ocean) witnessed a consensus among immunologists on the key role of regulatory T-cells in the orchestration of trophoblastic invasion at the maternal-fetal interface, while they represent some 10% of the immunological cellular repertoire at the site of implantation (NK cells representing 70%). On the vascular side, the upregulation of carbon monoxide CO, metabolite of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1; by inhibiting soluble Flt-1, SFlt-1, and soluble endoglin, SEng, release), explains the very promising protective and potentially therapeutic effect of pravastatin in preeclampsia and the paradoxical strong protective effect of cigarette smoking on preeclampsia. Finally, there was, through a study performed on Mauritius island a great interest in the inositol phosphoglycans P-type (IPG-P) as a reliable, cheap, and predictive urinary test in preeclamptic women (a few weeks before the clinical onset of the disease). Besides the interest of a specific test, IPG-P may also partially explain the global endothelial cell disease encountered in preeclampsia.

We systematically reviewed the literature available up to July 2013 on the treatment of these tremors and retrieved the data of 487 patients published in 43 papers detailing the effects of given interventions on tremor severity. Treatment outcome was highly variable, depending on the specific type of intervention and tremor distribution. No specifically designed studies were available for the treatment of tremor associated with dystonia. As for the other tremors, drug efficacy was generally disappointing and a moderate effect was only found with anticholinergics, tetrabenazine, clonazepam, Î²-blockers and primidone; levodopa was only efficacious on tremor due to dopa-responsive dystonia. The largest amount of data was available for botulinum toxin injections, which provided a marked improvement, particularly for the management of axial tremors (head or vocal cords). In refractory DTs, deep brain stimulation of several targets was attempted. Deep brain stimulation of globus pallidus internus, thalamus or subthalamic area led to a marked improvement of dystonic axial or appendicular tremors in most cases refractory to other treatments. Few other non-invasive treatments, for example, orthotic device in PWT, have been used with anecdotal success. In conclusion, considering the lack of good-quality studies, future randomised controlled trials are needed. In absence of evidence-based guidelines, we propose an algorithm for the treatment of DT based on currently available data.","24167042","2014","7"

Particularly, ectopic pregnancies, ruptured or hemorrhagic ovarian cysts, ovarian or adnexal torsions, threatened or inevitable miscarriages, phlogistic gynecological disorders, complications involving the uterine fibroids, endometriosis, and spontaneous uterine rupture are possible acute complications. The diagnosis is suspected on the basis of symptoms (acute pelvic and/or abdominal pain, with or without vaginal bleeding or discharge, until acute abdomen with peritonitis), by means physical evaluation (abdominal, pelvic, and bimanual gynecological examinations), by means of transabdominal (TAS) and/or transvaginal (TVS) sonography, and laboratory tests. However, the diagnosis is often not that simple, especially when the symptoms and clinical signs are minimal, and ultrasound (US) examination is not diriment. The differential diagnosis of abdominal/pelvic pain is broad and includes primarily gastrointestinal and urogenital disorders.

Early in the course of the disease, superficial mucosal ulceration, sub mucosal edema and hemorrhage occur. Further progression leads to transmural necrosis leading sometimes to bowel perforation. Six cases encountered in our clinic in recent years led us to resume discussions on necrotizing enteritis, not because it is a rare disease, but due to the severe postoperative complications.<br />MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our lot consisted of four stage 1 patients and two with Bell stage III NEC and severe intestinal injury, necrosis, and perforation. All of the patients were diagnosed preoperatory with other surgical conditions, like appendicitis with peritonitis, perforated duodenal ulcer or acute cholecystitis.<br />RESULTS: We present to review two cases. For patients undergoing laparotomy, resection of the involved intestine mandates either enterostomy formation or primary anastomosis. An intermediate option is laparotomy with intestinal resection and delayed anastomosis 48 to 72 hours later. Because of the small number of patients in our lot, we cannot advise a certain surgical treatment, but a strategy involving bienterostomyper primam should be further analyzed. The choice of operative intervention reflects multiple variables, including age, physiologic status, institutional resources and surgeon preference based on experience. Primary peritoneal drainage for perforated NEC may help to resuscitate and treat a critically ill patient initially, and in some instances, may be definitive operative intervention.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Relatively rare disease, of unknown etiology and elusive pathogenesis, NEC has initial non-specific symptoms and clinical features that mimic more common surgical diseases. There is considerable controversy regarding which procedure is preferable. Currently, in the absence of rigorous evidence supporting the superiority of one approach over the other, surgical intervention depends mostly on the treating institution or the individual surgeon.","24340528",\N,\N

We carried out stepwise logistic regression analysis to determine the factors associated with a hip fracture.<br />RESULTS: Lower appendicular SMI (P < 0.001), leg SMI (P < 0.001), and higher prevalence of sarcopenia (P < 0.001) were observed in the HF group after controlling for age and sex. The arm SMI was similar in both groups (P > 0.95). In multivariate analysis, the presence of sarcopenia, older age and lower BMD were associated with the occurrence of a hip fracture (OR 1.476, P = 0.002; OR 1.103, P < 0.001; OR 0.082, P < 0.001; respectively).<br />CONCLUSION: This study showed a higher prevalence of sarcopenia and more reduced leg muscle mass in patients after a hip fracture than in the outclinic patients who did not have hip fractures. The results imply sarcopenia can be a risk factor for a hip fracture.","22816427","2013","4"

Cancer & chemotherapy","A 66 -year-old man presenting with a chief complaint of upper abdominal pain was diagnosed as having an advanced adenocarcinoma, type 2, of the lower third of the stomach after endoscopy was performed. An abdominal computed tomography( CT)scan revealed 4 lymph node metastases at the infrapyloric nodes(station No. 6)and the nodes around the proximal splenic artery(station No. 11p)and the abdominal aorta(station No. 16a2). The clinical stage was determined to be T3(SS)N2M1(LYM), Stage IV. Gastrectomy with D2 plus para-aortic node dissection was scheduled after 2 courses of S-1 plus cisplatin(CDDP)with curative intent. On day 14 after starting S-1 therapy, the patient complained of severe abdominal pain and peritoneal irritation of acute onset. Because the abdominal CT scan showed a large amount of intra-abdominal free air, we performed an urgent laparotomy with a tentative diagnosis of perforation of the gastric cancer. On laparotomy, we found a perforated malignant ulcer, 5 cm in maximum diameter, in the lesser curvature of the stomach; therefore, distal gastrectomy with D1 plus lymphadenectomy and reconstruction using the Roux-en-Y method were performed. At the end of the surgery, a macroscopic residual tumor remained in the para-aortic lymph node. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on day 23 after surgery. In the present case, despite the performance of urgent gastrectomy while the patient was receiving strong chemotherapy, perioperative management was successful, with no serious postoperative complication or adverse events as a result of the chemotherapy.","24423960","2014","1"
"384","Clinicopathologic characteristics of colonic carcinoid tumors.","The Journal of surgical research","BACKGROUND: Extra-appendiceal colonic carcinoids are uncommon neuroendocrine tumors with a poor prognosis compared with carcinoids of other gastrointestinal origins. Few studies have examined the clinicopathologic profile and behavior of this rare tumor.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on patients with colonic carcinoid tumors evaluated at a single tertiary care center between 1996 and 2012. Collected data included patient and tumor characteristics, presentation, treatment, recurrence, and survival. Results were integrated into a comprehensive review of the colonic carcinoid literature.<br />RESULTS: In total, 114 patients with colorectal carcinoid tumors were identified, and 15 patients with extra-appendiceal tumors were analyzed. The mean age was 58.6 Â± 3.0Â y, and subjects were predominantly male (73.3%). The most common presenting problem was abdominal pain (33.3%), although 26.7% of patients were asymptomatic. Cecal tumors were the most prevalent (73.3%), and most patients underwent right hemicolectomy. Three patients with lesions < 1Â cm were treated endoscopically. The mean tumor diameter was 2.9 Â± 0.5Â cm, with lymph node or distant metastasis present in 53.3% and 26.7%, respectively. All but two patients underwent a presumed curative resection. During a mean follow-up of 4.2 Â± 1.0Â y, there was only one death (non-carcinoid specific). Eleven patients were alive without evidence of disease at last follow-up and three patients were alive with disease, one of whom initially had a presumed curative resection that recurred.<br />CONCLUSIONS: This case series further elucidates the clinicopathologic characteristics of colonic carcinoid tumors, which aids physicians in guiding the diagnosis and management of these rare tumors.","23830363","2013","9"

"386","Association of dairy intake with body composition and physical function in older community-dwelling women.","Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics","Impaired muscle function has been demonstrated to be an important predictor of frailty and fracture in elderly people. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the association of dairy intake with body composition and physical performance in 1,456 older women aged 70 to 85 years. Participants were assessed for dairy consumption (milk, yogurt, and cheese) by a validated food frequency questionnaire, body composition by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and physical performance using hand-grip strength and Timed Up and Go tests. Data on falls in the previous 3 months were collected. Women were categorized according to tertiles of dairy intake: first tertile (â‰¤1.5 servings/day), second tertile (1.5 to 2.2 servings/day), and third tertile (â‰¥2.2 servings/day). Main outcomes were compared using analysis of covariance adjusting for confounding factors. Odds ratios for self-reported falls and risk of poor Timed Up and Go were obtained by using binary logistic regression. The mean age was 75.2Â±2.7 years and body mass index was 27.2Â±4.7. Compared with those in the first tertile of dairy intake, women in the third tertile had significantly greater whole body lean mass (34.4Â±0.3 vs 32.9Â±0.3 kg; P=0.001) and appendicular skeletal muscle mass (15.3Â±0.2 vs 14.5Â±0.2 kg; P=0.002), greater hand-grip strength (20.9Â±0.2 vs 20.0Â±0.2 kg; P=0.02), and 26% lower odds for a poor Timed Up and Go test (P=0.04); however, the difference in prevalence of falls in the previous 3 months was not statistically significant (10.3% vs 14.4%; P=0.08). Our results suggest an association of higher dairy intake with greater whole body lean mass and better physical performance in older women.","23911336","2013","12"

NPhys Trial 3 showed that attributes of nerve conduction (NC) were without significant intraobserver differences, although there were significant interobserver differences.<br />METHODS: Trial 4 tested whether use of written instructions and pretrial agreement on techniques and use of standard reference values, diagnostic percentile values, or broader categorization of abnormality could reduce significant interobserver disagreement and improve agreement among clinical neurophysiologists.<br />RESULTS: The Trial 4 modifications markedly decreased, but did not eliminate, significant interobserver differences of measured attributes of NC. Use of standard reference values and defined percentile values of abnormality decreased interobserver disagreement and improved agreement of judgment of abnormality among evaluators. Therefore, the same clinical neurophysiologist should perform repeat NCs of therapeutic trial patients.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Differences in interobserver judgment of abnormality decrease with use of common standard reference values and a defined percentile level of abnormality, providing a rationale for their use in therapeutic trials and medical practice.","24644133","2014","12"

Group 2 was housed in an artificial setting and fed vegetables grown for human consumption. Group 3 was maintained in an outside enclosure and fed naturally growing vegetation. After 10 months, pyramidal growth, body weight, and adverse conditions were assessed. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the axial and appendicular skeleton, shell, vertebral column, and pelvis was measured via DXA.<br />RESULTS: Group 2 had the highest mean Â± SD body weight (65.42 Â± 30.85 g), followed by group 1 (51.08 Â± 22.92 g) and group 3 (35.74 Â± 7.13 g). Mean BMD of the shell varied significantly among groups (group 1, 0.05 Â± 0.03 g/cm(2)â€¢m; group 2, 0.09 Â± 0.15 g/cm(2)â€¢m; and group 3, undetectable). The BMD of the axial and appendicular skeleton, vertebral column, and pelvis did not differ significantly among groups.

Supplemental calcium was apparently not necessary when an adequate photothermal habitat and plant-based diet were provided. Higher BMD of captive-raised tortoises was morphologically associated with a higher incidence of pyramidal growth in captive-raised groups.","23718661","2013","6"
"390","Incidence of port-site incisional hernia after single-incision laparoscopic surgery.","JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons / Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Single-incision laparoscopic surgery is gaining popularity among minimally invasive surgeons and is now being applied to a broad number of surgical procedures. Although this technique uses only 1 port, the diameter of the incision is larger than in standard laparoscopic surgery. The long-term incidence of port-site hernias after single-incision laparoscopic surgery has yet to be determined.<br />METHODS: All patients who underwent a single-incision laparoscopic surgical procedure from May 2008 through May 2009 were included in the study. Single-incision laparoscopic surgical operations were performed either by a multiport technique or with a 3-trocar single-incision laparoscopic surgery port. The patients were seen at 30 to 36 months' follow-up, at which time they were examined for any evidence of port-site incisional hernia. Patients found to have hernias on clinical examination underwent repairs with mesh.<br />RESULTS: A total of 211 patients met the criteria for inclusion in the study. The types of operations included were cholecystectomy, appendectomy, sleeve gastrectomy, gastric banding, Nissen fundoplication, colectomy, and gastrojejunostomy. We found a port-site hernia rate of 2.9% at 30 to 36 months' follow-up.<br />CONCLUSION: Port-site incisional hernia after single-incision laparoscopic surgical procedures remains a major setback for patients. The true incidence remains largely unknown because most patients are asymptomatic and therefore do not seek surgical aid.","24960483",\N,\N

"394","Phenotypic dissection of bone mineral density reveals skeletal site specificity and facilitates the identification of novel loci in the genetic regulation of bone mass attainment.","PLoS genetics","Heritability of bone mineral density (BMD) varies across skeletal sites, reflecting different relative contributions of genetic and environmental influences. To quantify the degree to which common genetic variants tag and environmental factors influence BMD, at different sites, we estimated the genetic (rg) and residual (re) correlations between BMD measured at the upper limbs (UL-BMD), lower limbs (LL-BMD) and skull (SK-BMD), using total-body DXA scans of âˆ¼ 4,890 participants recruited by the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and their Children (ALSPAC). Point estimates of rg indicated that appendicular sites have a greater proportion of shared genetic architecture (LL-/UL-BMD rg = 0.78) between them, than with the skull (UL-/SK-BMD rg = 0.58 and LL-/SK-BMD rg = 0.43). Likewise, the residual correlation between BMD at appendicular sites (r(e) = 0.55) was higher than the residual correlation between SK-BMD and BMD at appendicular sites (r(e) = 0.20-0.24). To explore the basis for the observed differences in rg and re, genome-wide association meta-analyses were performed (n âˆ¼ 9,395), combining data from ALSPAC and the Generation R Study identifying 15 independent signals from 13 loci associated at genome-wide significant level across different skeletal regions. Results suggested that previously identified BMD-associated variants may exert site-specific effects (i.e. differ in the strength of their association and magnitude of effect across different skeletal sites). In particular, variants at CPED1 exerted a larger influence on SK-BMD and UL-BMD when compared to LL-BMD (P = 2.01 Ã— 10(-37)), whilst variants at WNT16 influenced UL-BMD to a greater degree when compared to SK- and LL-BMD (P = 2.31 Ã— 10(-14)). In addition, we report a novel association between RIN3 (previously associated with Paget's disease) and LL-BMD (rs754388: Î² = 0.13, SE = 0.02, P = 1.4 Ã— 10(-10)). Our results suggest that BMD at different skeletal sites is under a mixture of shared and specific genetic and environmental influences. Allowing for these differences by performing genome-wide association at different skeletal sites may help uncover new genetic influences on BMD.","24945404","2014","6"

They most often become symptomatic in childhood and rarely undergo malignant transformation. Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is an equally uncommon condition, most frequently originating from a primary appendiceal mucinous neoplasm. We report an extremely unusual case of PMP arising from an intestinal duplication. A 67-year-old woman presented with vague upper abdominal pain, and, unexpectedly, explorative laparoscopy revealed diffuse jelly-like peritoneal implants. The histopathological diagnosis of a low-grade PMP or \"disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis\" was made. At that moment, no primary tumor was found. During later surgery, a cystic lesion located in the mesentery of the small bowel could be resected. Histologically, the cyst wall clearly showed the concentric layering of a normal bowel wall. The mucosa, however, displayed a diffuse low-grade villous adenoma. We concluded that this histological picture was most consistent with a small intestinal duplication, containing a low-grade villous adenoma. The adenoma caused a mucocele, which subsequently leaked or ruptured, giving rise to noninvasive mucinous peritoneal implants or low-grade PMP, also known as \"disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis\" (DPAM).","24024058","2013",\N

Recent changes in understanding its natural history have substantially modified treatment paradigms.<br />OBJECTIVE: To review the etiology and natural history of diverticulitis and recent changes in treatment guidelines.<br />EVIDENCE REVIEW: We searched the MEDLINE and Cochrane databases for English-language articles pertaining to diagnosis and management of diverticulitis published between January 1, 2000, and March 31, 2013. Search terms applied to 4 thematic topics: pathophysiology, natural history, medical management, and indications for surgery. We excluded small case series and articles based on data accrued prior to 2000. We hand searched the bibliographies of included studies, yielding a total of 186 articles for full review. We graded the level of evidence and classified recommendations by size of treatment effect, according to the guidelines from the American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines.<br />FINDINGS: Eighty articles met criteria for analysis. The pathophysiology of diverticulitis is associated with altered gut motility, increased luminal pressure, and a disordered colonic microenvironment. Several studies examined histologic commonalities with inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome but were focused on associative rather than causal pathways. The natural history of uncomplicated diverticulitis is often benign. For example, in a cohort study of 2366 of 3165 patients hospitalized for acute diverticulitis and followed up for 8.9 years, only 13.3% of patients had a recurrence and 3.9%, a second recurrence. In contrast to what was previously thought, the risk of septic peritonitis is reduced and not increased with each recurrence. Patient-reported outcomes studies show 20% to 35% of patients managed nonoperatively progress to chronic abdominal pain compared with 5% to 25% of patients treated operatively. Randomized trials and cohort studies have shown that antibiotics and fiber were not as beneficial as previously thought and that mesalamine might be useful. Surgical therapy for chronic disease is not always warranted.<br />CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Recent studies demonstrate a lesser role for aggressive antibiotic or surgical intervention for chronic or recurrent diverticulitis than was previously thought necessary.","24430321","2014","1"

Differential diagnosis is essential because of its influence on patient management. Two patients are presented, one with pneumobilia and the other with portal vein gas on abdominal x-ray, with review of the relevant literature. Pneumobilia is often iatrogenic and even in cases of cholecystitis it is never a sole indication for emergency surgery. Patients with pneumobilia on abdominal x-ray can always be investigated further. On the other hand, the presence of air in portal vein is in most cases a sign of acute mesenteric ischemia. In adults with abdominal pain indicating intestinal ischemia (pain that is 'out of proportion' to clinical abdominal examination findings), it is an indication for emergency exploratory laparotomy. It is vital to act early when intestinal ischemia is suspected.","24558770","2013","9"

The aim of this study was to assess the outcomes of appendicectomy before and after the introduction of a consultant-led emergency general surgery (EGS) service at a large metropolitan tertiary referral centre.<br />METHODS: A retrospective historical control study was performed that included all adult patients undergoing appendicectomy during two 18-month periods, before and after the introduction of the EGS service. Data collected included patient demographics, use of radiological investigations, time to surgery, length of hospital stay and histopathology findings. Outcome measures were time to surgery, hospital length of stay, use of radiological investigations, negative appendicectomy rate and perforation rate.<br />RESULTS: A total of 675 patients were identified of whom 276 had an appendicectomy before the EGS service was introduced (2008-2009) and 399 after its introduction (2011-2012). The EGS service resulted in an increase in time to surgery (15 versus 18â€‰h; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) with no increase in length of hospital stay (3â€‰days for both periods; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.424).

Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence or not of recurrent appendicitis (or predisposing pathological findings during interval appendectomy). Several clinical and imaging factors were compared between both groups using an independent and progressive analysis to identify which were the most relevant predictors.<br />RESULTS: The persistence of symptoms after resolution of the appendicular inflammatory mass, as well as its time of resolution (p<0.001), were the most relevant factors during group classification. The identification of an ultrasonographic image of an appendicolith and the initial size of the mass were also identified as independent predictors (p<0.018 and p<0.01). The presence of the first two factors in a patient was strongly associated with recurrent appendicitis.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Persistent symptoms after the recovery of the initial episode, associated with a slow resolution of the appendicular inflammatory mass, are indications for an interval appendectomy. A previous history of appendicitis or detection of an ultrasonographic image of an appendicolith is the other indication for an interval appendectomy.","24214939","2014","2"

The mean age of all patients was 11.2 years (range, 1 to 18 years). There were no conversions in the LA or SILA groups. There was a significant difference among surgical technique in regard to surgical supply costs (OA $159 vs. LA $650 vs. SILA $814, P < 0.01) and total direct costs (OA $2129 vs. LA $2624 vs. SILA $2991, P < 0.01). In our institution, both multiport laparoscopic and SILA carry higher costs when compared with OA, largely as a result of the cost of disposable instrumentation. Cost efficiency should be considered by surgeons when undertaking a minimally invasive approach to appendectomy.","24069975","2013","9"

On examination, she was febrile (100 Â· F), tachycardic and normotensive. Examination of the abdomen revealed an ill-defined tender mass in the right iliac fossa. A clinical diagnosis of appendicular mass was made and treated conservatively. After a few days the mass became smaller, firmer, mobile and non-tender. Since the mass persisted, the patient was investigated further to rule out carcinoma of the caecum. A contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) of the abdomen showed a mass with air pockets in the caecum, suggestive of caecal faecolith. After 6 weeks, appendicectomy and removal of the faecolith were performed. The postoperative period was uneventful. Histopathology of the appendix showed inflammatory changes confirming appendicitis.","24469845","2014",\N
"407","Characteristics of hospitals with lowest costs in management of pediatric appendicitis.","Journal of pediatric surgery","BACKGROUND: A primary determinant of value in treating appendicitis is inpatient cost. The purpose of this study was to identify hospital-level factors that drive costs associated with the treatment of appendicitis.<br />METHODS: Cost-to-charge ratios from the 2009 Kids' Inpatient Database gave average all-payer costs by hospital for uncomplicated appendicitis (without peritonitis, ICD-9-CM 540.9) and complicated appendicitis (generalized peritonitis, 540.0; peritoneal abscess, 540.1). The 10% of hospitals with the lowest costs were defined as low cost; the remaining 90% were defined non-low cost. Bivariate and multivariate analyses compared hospital characteristics between the two groups.<br />RESULTS: Threshold cost dividing low cost from non-low cost for uncomplicated appendicitis was $4626; for complicated appendicitis, it was $6,026. For both conditions teaching status, lower percentage of pediatric discharges, and fewer registered nurses (RN) per 1000 adjusted patient-days predicted a hospital to be low cost. A cost benefit for medium and large hospitals and higher inpatient volume was found only for uncomplicated appendicitis. Regional effects were noted.<br />CONCLUSIONS: The findings show the high-cost structure of hospitals that care for high volumes of children, emphasizing the need to constrain cost. There is some benefit of economies of scale, and careful attention to the numbers of nursing personnel.","24210206","2013","11"
"408","A case of a duodenal duplication cyst presenting as melena.","World journal of gastroenterology : WJG","Duodenal duplication cysts are benign rare congenital anomalies reported mainly in the pediatric population, but seldom in adults. Symptoms depend on the type and location and can present as abdominal pain, distension, dysphagia or dyspepsia. They have been reported to be responsible for duodenal obstruction, pancreatitis and, in rare cases, gastrointestinal bleeding. We present a case of a duodenal duplication cyst in a 43-year-old man presenting as melena. Initial gastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy did not reveal any bleeding focus. However, the patient began passing melena after 3 d, with an acute decrease in hemoglobin levels. Subsequent studies revealed a duplication cyst in the second portion of the duodenum which was surgically resected. Histology revealed a duodenal duplication cyst consisting of intestinal mucosa. There was no further bleeding and the patient recovered completely. In rare cases, duodenal duplication cysts might cause gastrointestinal bleeding and should be included in the differential diagnosis.","24151370","2013","10"
"409","Diagnosing and managing inflammatory bowel disease.","The Practitioner","The two major types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Both are characterised by a relapsing and remitting course. In ulcerative colitis the mucosal inflammation affects the rectum and to a variable extent the areas proximal to the rectum in a continuous pattern. Crohn's disease is characterised by discontinuous areas of transmural inflammation that can affect any part of the GI tract but most frequently involves the distal small intestine and proximal colon. IBD has a prevalence of around 400 per 100,000 in the UK. There is a bimodal age of presentation with an initial peak in the second and third decades of life followed by another peak in the sixth decade. Acute ulcerative colitis typically presents with bloody diarrhoea with the passage of mucus, urgency and cramping abdominal pain. A severe attack is usually considered to be associated with bloody stools six times a day or more plus one of the features of systemic toxicity. Severe attacks require intensive inpatient treatment. Inflammatory markers in the blood are not always raised in ulcerative colitis. The diagnosis is confirmed by typical histological features on biopsy. Crohn's disease presents with a typical combination of abdominal pain, diarrhoea and weight loss. Pain or fever may also signify the development of an abscess and stricture formation will lead to obstructive symptoms. Perianal disease in the form of abscesses or fistulae may affect 35-45% of patients during the course of their disease. Because of the chronic and, at times, debilitating nature of IBD special attention to the psychosocial aspects of the disease is very important.","24191430",\N,\N

Few physicians (37%) and ADs (6%) reported an awareness of the PPE Monograph. Knowledge of the Monograph did not vary by physician type, practice/school location, or experience (P > 0.05). Reported obstacles to the delivery of the PPE included time with patient (56%) and the lack of a standard form (52%). Physician awareness of the Monograph reduced the perception of obstacles (P < 0.01). Athletic directors reported financial limitations of the family as the primary obstacle (62%). Adoption of a single statewide PPE form was well supported (96% of physicians and 67% of ADs). Nationally, only 46% of state athletic associations mandate a single form, and only 16% use a form consistent with the Fourth Edition PPE Monograph.<br />CONCLUSIONS: The medical community is largely unaware of national screening guidelines.

We conducted an investigation to identify the agent and mode of transmission and to recommend control measures.<br />METHODS: A suspected case was a person at the college with onset of â‰¥Â two of the following symptoms: diarrhoea (more than three loose stools in 24 hours), abdominal pain, vomiting or fever (>Â 37.5C) between 6 and 15 May 2012. A confirmed case also had a positive Aeromonas hydrophila culture from a stool sample. A retrospective-cohort study of 902 students compared attack rates (AR) by dining place, meals and food history. We reviewed the implicated premise, its processes and preparation of implicated food.<br />RESULTS: We identified 349 suspected cases (ARÂ =Â 14%) and isolated Aeromonas hydrophila from three stools of 15 cases. Students who ate in cafeteria A were more likely to be ill compared to those eating in other places (relative risk [RR]:Â 3.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]:Â 2.0-4.8). The cohort study implicated cold cucumber (RR:Â 2.6, 95% CI:Â 2.0-3.3) and houttuynia dishes (RR:Â 1.8, 95% CI: 1.4-2.3). Environmental investigation showed that vegetables were washed in polluted water from a tank close to the sewage ditch, then left at 30 Â°C for two hours before serving. The Escherichia coli count of the tank was well above the standard for drinking-water.<br />CONCLUSION: This outbreak of Aeromonas hydrophila was most probably caused by salad ingredients washed in contaminated tank water.

Although health information on the Internet is plentiful, the quality and availability of information on circumcision, including dissemination of AAP and AUA policy statements, is unknown. We analyzed English and Spanish circumcision websites to evaluate their overall quality, detail, accuracy, and bias.<br />METHODS: In April 2013, three search engines were queried for English and Spanish circumcision websites, which were analyzed utilizing the DISCERN Plus scale for content quality as well as additional study-specific criteria.<br />RESULTS: We analyzed 214 websites (141 English, 73 Spanish). Most websites in both languages had very good content quality and were neutral regarding circumcision. Regardless of language, only 21% of sites mentioned the updated AAP guidelines. Surprisingly, the AUA circumcision policy statement did not appear in the top results. Spanish sites were more likely to give good descriptions of circumcision procedures than English sites (pÂ <Â 0.04), less likely to cite sources (pÂ <Â 0.01), and more likely to describe benefits (pÂ =Â 0.02)..<br />CONCLUSIONS: Newborn circumcision information on the Internet is of very good quality, but different English and Spanish characteristics possibly reflect cultural bias, which may explain the disparate rates of circumcision between different groups in the USA. The AAP's circumcision policy statement was referenced by a minority (20%) of websites, and AUA's policy statement was not even part of the top results.

We aimed to compare outcomes of nerve identification and preservation with a careful dissection during Lichtenstein repair of inguinal hernia between normal courses of inguinal based nerves and variable courses of inguinal based nerves.<br />METHODS: This is a prospective study and 116 adult male patients with primary inguinal hernia were operated between December 2009 and June 2010. The patients with a normal nerve trace identified on exploration were assigned into Group Normal Course and those with variable nerve course were assigned into Group Variable Course. These two groups were compared in terms of demographic features, preoperative and postoperative variables, return to work and daily routines, duration of fulfilling personal needs, visual analogue scores before and one and six months after surgery, four-point verbal-rank scale scores, numbness and patient satisfaction.<br />RESULTS: Out of 116 patients, 70 (60.3%) had variable courses of the nerves and were assigned into the Group Variable Course and 46 (39.7%) had normal courses of the nerves and were assigned into Group Normal Course. A single stem for both nerves over spermatic cord (21.6%) and acute infero-lateral angulation of the Ilioinguinal nerve in close contact with and parallel to the Superficial Inguinal Ring fibers at exit (15.5%) were the most observed variations. Duration of surgery was significantly longer in Group Variable Course (p <0.001). Numbness was also slightly higher in this group one month after surgery. This difference nearly disappeared six months after surgery.<br />CONCLUSION: Although careful and gentle exploration increases the duration of surgery and early neuropraxia, identification and preservation of nerves during surgery for inguinal hernia help to achieve similar outcomes in both patients with a normal course of nerves and those with a variable course of nerves.","24941716",\N,\N

"419","Electrospray ionization mechanisms for large polyethylene glycol chains studied through tandem ion mobility spectrometry.","Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry","Ion mobility mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) is used to investigate the abundance pattern, nz(m) of Poly-(ethyleneglycol) (PEG) electrosprayed from water/methanol as a function of mass and charge state. We examine nz(m) patterns from a diversity of solution cations, primarily dimethylammonium and triethylammonium. The ability of PEG chains to initially attach to various cations in the spraying chamber, and to retain them (or not) on entering the MS, provide valuable clues on the ionization mechanism. Single chains form in highly charged and extended shapes in most buffers. But the high initial charge they hold under atmospheric pressure is lost on transit to the vacuum system for large cations. In contrast, aggregates of two or more chains carry in all buffers at most the Rayleigh charge of a water drop of the same volume. This shows either that they form via Dole's charge residue mechanism, or that highly charged and extended aggregates are ripped apart by Coulombic repulsion. IMS-IMS experiments in He confirm these findings, and provide new mechanistic insights on the stability of aggregates. When collisionally activated, initially globular dimers are stable. However, slightly nonglobular dimers projecting out a linear appendix are segregated into two monomeric chains. The breakup of a charged dimer is therefore a multi-step process, similar to the Fenn-Consta polymer extrusion mechanism. The highest activation barrier is associated to the first step, where a short chain segment carrying a single charge escapes (ion-evaporates) from a charged drop, leading then to gradual field extrusion of the whole chain out of the drop.","24924517","2014","8"

The technique employs an advanced signal model for T2 relaxation that accounts for contributions from indirect echoes in a train of multiple spin echoes. An iterative solution of the nonlinear inverse reconstruction problem directly estimates spin-density and T2 maps from undersampled raw data. The algorithm is validated for simulated data as well as phantom and human brain MRI at 3T. The performance of the advanced model is compared to conventional pixel-based fitting of echo-time images from fully sampled data. The proposed method yields more accurate T2 values than the mono-exponential model and allows for retrospective undersampling factors of at least 6. Although limitations are observed for very long T2 relaxation times, respective reconstruction problems may be overcome by a gradient dampening approach. The analytical gradient of the utilized cost function is included as Appendix. The source code is made available to the community.","24988592","2014","6"

We report a case of recurrent pancreatitis leading to pancreatic necrosis treated at KCH.<br />PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 42 year-old male presented to KCH with his fourth episode of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. He had tachycardia, guarding, rebound tenderness, and free fluid on abdominal ultrasonography. He underwent laparotomy and had fat saponification with pancreatic necrosis. A large drain was placed, he was given antibiotics, and he recovered. He had normal lipids, no gallstones, and did not consume alcohol. He was encouraged to seek further evaluation with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or computed tomography in South Africa, however this was prohibitively expensive.<br />DISCUSSION: This case illustrates the limitations that are often faced by surgeons visiting developing countries. What we consider standard resources and treatment algorithms in managing necrotizing pancreatitis in developed countries (such as serum lipase and percutaneous interventions) were not available.<br />CONCLUSION: Visiting surgeons and trainees must be both familiar with local resource limitations and aware of the implications of such limitations on patient care. To support training and promote advances in health care, local surgeons and trainees should understand optimal treatment strategies regardless of their particular resource limitations. North-South partnerships are an excellent means to uphold our professional obligation to humanity, promote health care as a right, and shape the future of health care in developing countries.","24252412","2013",\N

Single port laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has been proposed as an alternative technique. The objective of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of SILS against conventional laparoscopic appendectomy (LA).<br />MATERIAL AND METHODS: From January 2011 to September 2012, 120 patients with acute appendicitis were prospectively randomized; 60 for SILS and 60 for LA. Patients between 15 to 65 years were selected, with onset of symptoms less than 48h. We compared BMI, surgery time, start of oral intake, hospital stay, postoperative pain, pathology and costs.<br />RESULTS: The median age, BMI, sex and time of onset of symptoms to diagnosis were similar. There were no statistically significant differences in the operative time, start of oral intake or hospital stay. There was a significant difference in postoperative pain being higher in SILS (4Â±1.3) than in LA (3.3Â±0.5) with a P=.004. Flemonous appendicitis predominated in both groups in a similar percentage. A total of 3 cases with intra-abdominal abscess (SILS 2, LA 1) required readmission and resolved spontaneously with intravenous antibiotic treatment. One case of SILS required assistance by a 5mm trocar in the RLC for drainage placement. The cost was higher in SILS due the single port device.<br />CONCLUSION: SILS appendectomy is safe, effective and has similar results to LA in selected patients, and although the cost is greater, the long term results will determine the future of this technique.","24581876",\N,\N

We therefore developed anthropometric prediction equations to estimate the LBM and appendicular lean soft tissue (ALST) using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as a reference method. Healthy volunteers (n = 2,220; 36% women; age 18-79 yr), representing a wide range of body mass index (14-44 kg/m(2)), participated in this study. Their LBM, including ALST, was assessed by DXA along with anthropometric measurements. The sample was divided into prediction (60%) and validation (40%) sets. In the prediction set, a number of prediction models were constructed using DXA-measured LBM and ALST estimates as dependent variables and a combination of anthropometric indices as independent variables. These equations were cross-validated in the validation set. Simple equations using age, height, and weight explained >90% variation in the LBM and ALST in both men and women. Additional variables (hip and limb circumferences and sum of skinfold thicknesses) increased the explained variation by 5-8% in the fully adjusted models predicting LBM and ALST. More complex equations using all of the above anthropometric variables could predict the DXA-measured LBM and ALST accurately, as indicated by low standard error of the estimate (LBM: 1.47 kg and 1.63 kg for men and women, respectively), as well as good agreement by Bland-Altman analyses (Bland JM, Altman D. Lancet 1: 307-310, 1986). These equations could be a valuable tool in large epidemiological studies assessing these body compartments in Indians and other population groups with similar body composition.","23950165","2013","10"

"431","Effectiveness of individual-focused interventions to prevent chronic disease.","European journal of clinical investigation","BACKGROUND: The burden of chronic disease is projected to assume crisis proportions in most parts of the world by the middle of the century, focusing attention on the need for preventive interventions. We identify and review published research on primary prevention individual-level interventions in current practice and describe and discuss the limitations of the current evidence. The report facilitates prioritizing a research agenda for potential interventions that might be investigated within cohort studies.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a rapid review. Computerized database searches (PubMed and EMBASE) were performed in October 2012 to identify articles on primary prevention interventions that are directed at the individual level. Potentially, relevant International Agency of Research on Cancer handbooks and monographs were also reviewed. The review includes articles reported in English on the efficacy or effectiveness of a preventive intervention in an adult population. It excludes articles on alcohol or tobacco smoking.<br />RESULTS: Many chronic disease interventions directed at individuals report a protective effect in the short term and some evidence for the efficacy of chemoprevention in chronic disease prevention exists. Evidence these effects persist in the longer term is inconsistent.<br />CONCLUSIONS: There are currently only limited evidence-based preventions for most chronic diseases, for which a summary is available in Table A1 (see Appendix B). Most individual-level intervention research studies have been conducted using case-control designs and some small, randomized studies. There are fewer impediments to lifestyle modifications when compared to prevention using chemoprevention and vaccination or other methods of prevention of persistent infection.","25041535","2014","9"
"432","Development of acute pancreatitis caused by sodium valproate in a patient with bipolar disorder on hemodialysis for chronic renal failure: a case report.","BMC psychiatry","BACKGROUND: Cases of acute pancreatitis caused by sodium valproate (VPA) have been reported by many authors thus far. However, most of these were cases with epilepsy. Chronic renal failure is also regarded as a risk factor for acute pancreatitis. Here, we report a case of acute pancreatitis development due to VPA in a patient with bipolar disorder on hemodialysis for chronic renal failure.<br />CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 52-year-old Japanese male who was diagnosed as bipolar disorder on hemodialysis for renal failure. He was treated with VPA and manic symptoms gradually stabilized. However, the patient complained of severe abdominal pain. Blood amylase was found to be markedly high, and computed tomography revealed pancreatomegaly and an increased amount of peripancreatic fat. Hence, we diagnosed the case as acute pancreatitis caused by VPA. We discontinued oral medication, and he was started on a pancreatic enzyme inhibitor, antibiotics, and transfusion, and he showed improvement.<br />CONCLUSION: It has been reported that acute pancreatitis induced by VPA is caused by intermediate metabolites of VPA. We consider that patients with renal failure are prone to pancreatitis caused by VPA because of the accumulation of these intermediate metabolites. We need close monitoring for serious adverse effects such as pancreatitis when we prescribe VPA to patients with bipolar disorder on hemodialysis for chronic renal failure, although VPA is safer than other mood stabilizers.","24679075","2014",\N

We sought to determine the impact of an ACST on the depth and breadth of general surgery resident training.<br />METHODS: One year prior to and after implementation of an ACST, Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education case logs spanning multiple postgraduate year levels were compared for numbers, case types, and complexity.<br />RESULTS: We identified 6,009 cases, including 2,783 after ACST implementation. ACSTs accounted for 752 cases (27%), with 39.2% performed laparoscopically. ACST cases included biliary (19.4%), skin/soft tissue (10%), hernia (9.8%), and appendix (6.5%). Second-year residents performed a lower percentage of laparoscopic cases after the creation of the ACST (20.4% vs 26.3%; P = .003), while chief residents performed a higher percentage (42.1 vs 37.4; P = .04). Case numbers and complexity following ACST development were unchanged within all year groups (P > .1).<br />CONCLUSION: ACST in a residency program does not sacrifice resident case complexity, diversity, or volume.","25034411","2014","11"
"435","Current treatment of renal artery aneurysms may be too aggressive.","Journal of vascular surgery","OBJECTIVE: Most studies recommend repair of renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) >2 cm in diameter in asymptomatic patients, but other studies have suggested that their natural history may be more benign. We hypothesized that rupture and death in patients with asymptomatic RAAs is low and that current recommendations for RAA treatment at 2 cm may be too aggressive.<br />METHODS: Retrospective review of all RAAs treated at a tertiary care medical center from 2002 to 2012.<br />RESULTS: Fifty-nine RAA were identified in 40 patients (mean age at diagnosis, 56 years; male:female ratio, 17:23); 31 were saccular, 8 were fusiform, and 5 were bilobed. Twenty-nine patients were asymptomatic; the remainder of patients presented with hematuria (n = 4), abdominal pain (n = 3), difficult-to-control hypertension (n = 3), or flank pain (n = 2). Aneurysm location included the main renal artery bifurcation (n = 35), main trunk (n = 7), primary branch (n = 6), pole artery (n = 6), and secondary branch (n = 1). Operative management of RAAs included vein patch (n = 6), prosthetic patch (n = 4), primary repair (n = 3), plication (n = 1), patch and implantation (n = 1), and ex vivo repair (n = 1). Eight asymptomatic RAAs were treated surgically (mean RAA diameter = 2.4 Â± 0.1 cm, range, 2-3 cm), with the remaining 33 asymptomatic RAAs being managed conservatively (mean RAA diameter = 1.4 Â± 0.1 cm, range, 0.6-2.6 cm). Mean hospital length of stay was 4 days, with no late postoperative complications and 0% mortality. Non-operated patients were followed for a mean of 36 Â± 9 months, with no late acute complications and 0% mortality. Mean RAA growth rate of patients with multiple imaging studies was 0.60 Â± 0.16 mm/y.<br />CONCLUSIONS: The rate of aneurysm rupture and death in our untreated RAA patients is zero, the growth rate is 0.60 Â± 0.16 mm/y, and there were no adverse outcomes in asymptomatic RAAs >2 cm that were observed. We may currently be too aggressive in treating asymptomatic RAAs.","24462256","2014","5"
"436","Patients with inferior vena cava thrombosis frequently present with lower back pain and bilateral lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis.","VASA. Zeitschrift fÃ¼r GefÃ¤sskrankheiten","BACKGROUND: Inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis is rare, and data about the clinical presentation of patients are scarce. Therefore, we reviewed all cases of IVC thrombosis consecutively registered in the MAISTHRO (MAin-ISar-THROmbosis) database and described patientsÂ’ characteristics in terms of their clinical presentations in the acute setting of IVC thrombosis.<br />PATIENTS AND METHODS: From the MAISTHRO registry, which enrolled 1470 consecutive patients with documented histories of venous thromboembolism, we identified 60 patients (0,4 %; females 60 %) with IVC thrombosis and 888 patients (60.4 %; females 55 %) with isolated lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis (LE-DVT).<br />RESULTS: The median age at the time of IVC thrombosis manifestation was 36.5 years (9 to 83). IVC thrombosis was the initial VTE event in 47 patients (78 %). In the majority of cases, IVC thrombosis extended to the lower-extremity veins, and both lower extremities were affected in 17 cases (28 %). The initial clinical symptom of IVC thrombosis was lower back or abdominal pain which preceded typical symptoms of LE-DVT in 29 (48 %) patients. Symptomatic pulmonary embolism was more frequently observed in IVC thrombosis patients when compared to a sex- and age-matched subgroup of LE-DVT patients, although the difference was not significant (27 % vs. 12 %; p = 0.064). Malignant disease was the only established VTE risk factor with a higher prevalence among IVC thrombosis patients than patients with isolated LE-DVT (27 % vs. 9 %; p = 0.015). Congenital IVC anomalies were identified in another eight IVC thrombosis patients (13 %).<br />CONCLUSIONS: IVC thrombosis should be considered a differential diagnosis for inexplicable lower back or abdominal pain especially in young patients. Malignant disease and congenital IVC anomalies seem to be predisposing factors for thrombosis involving the inferior vena cava.","23823859","2013","7"

Therapeutic hypothermia is recommended by international guidelines, but the supporting evidence is limited, and the target temperature associated with the best outcome is unknown. Our objective was to compare two target temperatures, both intended to prevent fever.<br />METHODS: In an international trial, we randomly assigned 950 unconscious adults after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac cause to targeted temperature management at either 33Â°C or 36Â°C. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality through the end of the trial. Secondary outcomes included a composite of poor neurologic function or death at 180 days, as evaluated with the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scale and the modified Rankin scale.<br />RESULTS: In total, 939 patients were included in the primary analysis. At the end of the trial, 50% of the patients in the 33Â°C group (235 of 473 patients) had died, as compared with 48% of the patients in the 36Â°C group (225 of 466 patients) (hazard ratio with a temperature of 33Â°C, 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89 to 1.28; P=0.51). At the 180-day follow-up, 54% of the patients in the 33Â°C group had died or had poor neurologic function according to the CPC, as compared with 52% of patients in the 36Â°C group (risk ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.16; P=0.78). In the analysis using the modified Rankin scale, the comparable rate was 52% in both groups (risk ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.14; P=0.87). The results of analyses adjusted for known prognostic factors were similar.<br />CONCLUSIONS: In unconscious survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac cause, hypothermia at a targeted temperature of 33Â°C did not confer a benefit as compared with a targeted temperature of 36Â°C.

"438","Addressing the ethical challenges in genetic testing and sequencing of children.","The American journal of bioethics : AJOB","American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) recently provided two recommendations about predictive genetic testing of children. The Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Consortium's Pediatrics Working Group compared these recommendations, focusing on operational and ethical issues specific to decision making for children. Content analysis of the statements addresses two issues: (1) how these recommendations characterize and analyze locus of decision making, as well as the risks and benefits of testing, and (2) whether the guidelines conflict or come to different but compatible conclusions because they consider different testing scenarios. These statements differ in ethically significant ways. AAP/ACMG analyzes risks and benefits using best interests of the child and recommends that, absent ameliorative interventions available during childhood, clinicians should generally decline to order testing. Parents authorize focused tests. ACMG analyzes risks and benefits using the interests of the child and other family members and recommends that sequencing results be examined for additional variants that can lead to ameliorative interventions, regardless of age, which laboratories should report to clinicians who should contextualize the results. Parents must accept additional analysis. The ethical arguments in these statements appear to be in tension with each other.","24592828","2014","3"

Imaging tests had been performed over the previous 3 years; however, clinicians could not find the origin of the abscess and failed to resolve the problem. A successful operation was performed via a laparoscopic approach, and 17 mo have passed without recurrence. The advantage of laparoscopic surgery is well understood in cases of appendicitis with abscesses. However, the indication for laparoscopic approach is not clear for retroperitoneal abscesses.

There is a spectrum of neurologic symptoms ranging from oculomotor apraxia to severe convulsions. The heterozygosity of phenotypes makes it difficult to predict the disease course. We describe an 8-year-old male with neuronopathic type III Gaucher disease who developed bladder dysfunction and was unable to completely void. He also presented with hypertension and acute renal insufficiency, most likely secondary to urinary retention. A complete evaluation was done for causes of urinary retention and bladder dysfunction. A renal bladder ultrasound demonstrated marked hydroureteronephrosis. There was no clinical evidence of infection and cystoscopy revealed no anatomic obstruction. In addition, MRI showed no spinal abnormalities. His bladder dysfunction was managed operatively by creating a catheterizable stoma, using his appendix, to empty his bladder, and surgical findings were consistent with neurogenic bladder. He continues to be managed for his Gaucher disease and neurogenic bladder by genetics, nephrology and urology. This is the first clinical report of neurogenic bladder dysfunction in neuronopathic Gaucher disease.","24664877","2015",\N

Abdominal computer tomography revealed a sizable formation that was diagnosed as a tumor of the pancreas. In laparotomy, a choloperitoneum was diagnosed as the cause of patient's symptoms. A tumor adherent firmly to the lesser curvature of stomach was also discovered. Cholecystectomy and subtotal gastrectomy were performed. Histologically, the tumor was diagnosed as a EGIST of the lesser omentum. The patient did not receive any adjuvant therapy and after two years of follow up she is without any recurrence.<br />DISCUSSION: Omental EGISTs may remain clinically silent despite the large tumor's size. It is difficult to differentiate a EGIST in the lesser omentum from a GIST of the lesser curvature of the stomach, despite the use of advanced radiological imaging techniques. Our case of a giant EGIST of lesser omentum obscuring the diagnosis of acute choloperitoneum is the only one reported in literature.<br />CONCLUSION: EGISTs that arise from the omentum are very rare and complete surgical resection is the only effective treatment approach.

It is a common complaint and may be the presenting symptom of several life-threatening conditions. It can be caused by a variety of organic and nonorganic disorders; gastrointestinal (GI) or outside of GI. Acute gastritis and gastroenteritis (AGE) are the leading cause of acute vomiting in children. Important life threatening causes in infancy include congenital intestinal obstruction, atresia, malrotation with volvulus, necrotizing enterocolitis, pyloric stenosis, intussusception, shaken baby syndrome, hydrocephalus, inborn errors of metabolism, congenital adrenal hypoplasia, obstructive uropathy, sepsis, meningitis and encephalitis, and severe gastroenteritis, and in older children appendicitis, intracranial mass lesion, diabetic ketoacidosis, Reye's syndrome, toxic ingestions, uremia, and meningitis. Initial evaluation is directed at assessment of airway, breathing and circulation, assessment of hydration status and red flag signs (bilious or bloody vomiting, altered sensorium, toxic/septic/apprehensive look, inconsolable cry or excessive irritability, severe dehydration, concern for symptomatic hypoglycemia, severe wasting, Bent-over posture). The history and physical examination guides the approach in an individual patient. The diverse nature of causes of vomiting makes a \"routine\" laboratory or radiologic screen impossible. Investigations (Serum electrolytes and blood gases,renal and liver functions and radiological studies) are required in any child with dehydration or red flag signs, to diagnose surgical causes. Management priorities include treatment of dehydration, stoppage of oral fluids/feeds and decompression of the stomach with nasogastric tube in patients with bilious vomiting. Antiemetic ondansetron(0.2 mg/kg oral; parenteral 0.15 mg/kg; maximum 4 mg) is indicated in children unable to take orally due to persistent vomiting, post-operative vomiting, chemotherapy induced vomiting, cyclic vomiting syndrome and acute mountain sickness.","23340985","2013","4"

The geographic distribution of all tick species was congruent with the literature except for Haemaphysalis silacea. From each infested host, a maximum of 10 males and 10 females of each tick species were dissected to isolate the salivary glands. Salivary glands were screened for tick-borne pathogens using polymerase chain reaction followed by reverse line blotting and sequencing. This approach allowed us to evaluate the exposure of wild and domestic hosts to tick-borne pathogens in their respective environments. Among the 2117 examined ticks, 329 (15.5%), belonging to 8 species, were infected and harboured 397 infections. Among those, 57.7% were identified to species level and were assigned to 23 pathogen species of the genera Babesia, Theileria, Anaplasma, and Ehrlichia. In 3 out of 6 localities, salivary glands from ticks infesting wild ruminants displayed significantly higher infection prevalence and pathogen mean density than salivary glands from ticks infesting livestock animals. Four piroplasm species [Theileria bicornis, Babesia sp. (sable), Theileria sp. (giraffe), and Theileria sp. (kudu)] were detected for the first time in ticks. The tick species Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) decoloratus, Hyalomma rufipes, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, and Amblyomma hebraeum were associated with a broader pathogen range than previously known, and thus new vector-pathogen combinations are described.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the longest period of time reported for persistent pneumoperitoneum after laparoscopic surgery.<br />CONCLUSION: Absent clinical findings, introduction of atmospheric air into the abdominal cavity during the original laparoscopic surgery was the most likely cause and is supported by the literature. Pneumoperitoneum observed up to 48 d status post laparoscopic hysterectomy, in the absence of peritoneal signs, fever, leukocytosis, or hemodynamic instability, may be considered for expectant management and serial inspection for clinical change.","24398214",\N,\N
"451","Intraoperative near-infrared indocyanine green fluorescence angiography (NIR-ICG AG) can predict delayed small bowel stricture after ischemic intestinal injury: report of a case.","Journal of pediatric surgery","We herein report the case of a 15-year-old male who developed delayed intestinal stricture after undergoing massive intestinal resection due to severe small intestinal volvulus. At the time of the initial surgery, the laparotomy findings showed a massive intestinal volvulus without malrotation. Most of the small intestine appeared to be necrotic; therefore, massive necrotic intestinal resection was performed. The residual intestine comprised only the proximal jejunum and short ileum, including the ileocecal valve and entire colon. After the resection, the serosal surface color of the distal part of the residual jejunum (DPRJ) initially showed a slightly darker hue than normal. However, the color improved with time, and the other clinical findings also improved, which were considered to indicate that the perfusion of the DPRJ was preserved. The perfusion of that area was therefore clinically expected to improve with time. On the other hand, repeated intraoperative near-infrared indocyanine green fluorescence angiography (NIR-ICG AG) consistently showed abnormal vascular flow patterns in the same region, which were suspected to indicate the presence of perfusion damage of the DPRJ, in spite of improvements in the clinical findings. Although the necessity of additional resection was discussed at the time of reconstruction, we finally estimated that the perfusion of the DPRJ was preserved, mainly based on the improvement of the clinical findings of the intestine. The primary anastomosis was performed without additional resection, to maximize the lengths of the residual intestine. However, after the initial surgery, the patient developed a delayed partial stricture of the residual intestine, and an additional resection was necessary on the 22nd postoperative day. The stricture segment corresponded to the area that presented abnormal findings by NIR-ICG AG. This case suggests that abnormal NIR-ICG AG findings may predict delayed intestinal ischemic complications. We believe that NIR-ICG AG can intraoperatively provide more useful real time information for the assessment of intestinal perfusion, than conventional clinical assessment methods.","23701792","2013","5"

We report a case presenting an epigastric pain that was diagnosed after computed tomography as a perforated appendicitis on intestinal malrotation.<br />PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 27-year-old man was admitted with a three-day history of epigastric pain. Physical examination revealed tenderness and defense on palpation of epigastric region. There was a left subcostal incision with the history of diaphragmatic hernia repair when the patient was 3 days old. He had an intestinal malrotation with the cecum fixed at the epigastric region and the inflamed appendix extending beside the left lobe of liver.<br />DISCUSSION: While appendicitis is the most common abdominal disease requiring surgical intervention seen in the emergency room setting, intestinal malrotation is relatively uncommon. When patients with asymptomatic undiagnosed gastrointestinal malrotation clinically present with abdominal pain, accurate diagnosis and definitive therapy may be delayed, possibly increasing the risk of morbidity and mortality.<br />CONCLUSION: Atypical presentations of acute appendicitis should be kept in mind in patients with abdominal pain in emergency room especially in patients with previous childhood operation for diaphragmatic hernia.","24441442","2014",\N

"455","Nutritional support process for a patient with short bowel syndrome in conjunction with panperitonitis: a case report.","Clinical nutrition research","Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS) is a condition that causes malabsorption and nutrient deficiency because a large section of the small intestine is missing or has been surgically removed. SBS may develop congenitally or from gastroenterectomy, which often change the motility, digestive, and/or absorptive functions of the small bowel. The surgical procedure for SBS and the condition itself have high mortality rates and often lead to a range of complications associated with long-term parenteral nutrition (PN). Therefore, careful management and appropriate nutrition intervention are needed to prevent complications and to help maintain the physiologic integrity of the remaining intestinal functions. Initial postoperative care should provide adequate hydration, electrolyte support and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) to prevent fatal dehydration. Simultaneously, enteral nutrition should be gradually introduced, with the final goal of using only enteral nutrition support and/or oral intake and eliminating TPN from the diet. A patient should be considered for discharge when macro and micronutrients can be adequately supplied through enteral nutrition support or oral diet. Currently, there is more research on pediatric patients with SBS than on adult patient population. A 35-year-old man with no notable medical history was hospitalized and underwent a surgery for acute appendicitis at a local hospital. He was re-operated on the 8th day after the initial surgery due to complications and was under observation when he suddenly complained of severe abdominal pain and high fever. He was immediately transferred to a tertiary hospital where the medical team discovered free air in the abdomen. He was subsequently diagnosed with panperitonitis and underwent an emergency reoperation to explore the abdomen. Although the patient was expected to be at a high risk of malnutrition due to short bowel syndrome resulting from multiple surgeries, through intensive care under close cooperation between the medical and nutrition support team, his nutritional status improved significantly through continuous central and peripheral parenteral nutrition, enteral nutrition, and oral intake. The purpose of this paper is to report the process of the patient's recovery.","23908982","2013","7"
"456","What are the most clinically useful cutoffs for the Alvarado and Pediatric Appendicitis Scores? A systematic review.","Annals of emergency medicine","STUDY OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to systematically review the accuracy of the Alvarado score and Pediatric Appendicitis Score and to identify optimal cutoffs for low- and high-risk populations.<br />METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the literature and identified 26 studies of the accuracy of the Alvarado score and Pediatric Appendicitis Score. Data were abstracted in parallel, and only prospective, cohort studies that avoided verification bias were included. We calculated summary likelihood ratios for low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups, using all possible cutoffs based on available data, even if not reported in the original study.<br />RESULTS: The pretest probability of appendicitis was approximately 33% in studies of children and approximately 66% in studies of adults. Likelihood ratios at different cutoffs for the Alvarado score in adults were as follows: 0.03 (<4 points), 0.42 (4 to 6 points), and 3.4 (â‰¥ 7 points); and 0.01 (<5 points), 0.98 (5 to 8 points), and 6.7 (â‰¥ 9 points). Likelihood ratios for the Alvarado score in children were as follows: 0.02 (<4 points), 0.27 (4 to 6 points), and 4.2 (â‰¥ 7 points); and 0.04 (<5 points), 1.2 (5 to 8 points), and 8.5 (â‰¥ 9 points). For the Pediatric Appendicitis Score, likelihood ratios were 0.13 (<4 points), 0.70 (4 to 7 points), and 8.1 (â‰¥ 8 points).<br />CONCLUSION: For children with a pretest probability of acute appendicitis of 60% or less, an Alvarado score below 4 rules out the diagnosis; this is also true for a score less than 5 if the pretest probability is up to approximately 40%. In adults with a pretest probability greater than or equal to 60%, an Alvarado score of 8 or higher rules in the diagnosis, whereas one of 9 or higher rules in the diagnosis at pretest probabilities greater than or equal to 40%. The Pediatric Appendicitis Score did not identify clinically useful low- or high-risk groups at typical pretest probabilities.","24731432","2014","10"

"458","How to differentiate spontaneous intramural intestinal hemorrhage from acute mesenteric ischemia.","The American journal of emergency medicine","OBJECTS: The purpose of our study was to assess the diagnostic values of laboratory tests to differentiate spontaneous intramural intestinal hemorrhage (SIIH) from acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) after abdominal computed tomography (CT) survey in the emergency department (ED).<br />METHOD: We retrospectively included 76 patients diagnosed SIIH or AMI after abdominal CT.<br />RESULTS: The mean ages of 28 SIIH patients and 48 AMI patients were 75.9 Â± 13.7 years and 75.8 Â± 11.6 years, respectively. Patients with SIIH had significantly higher rate of Coumadin use (P < .001) and localized tenderness (P < .05). In laboratory findings, SIIH patients had prolonged prothrombin time (PT) (83.6 Â± 30.0 vs. 13.4 Â± 3.2, P < .001), lower blood urea nitrogen (P < .05), lower creatinine (P < .05), and lower creatine kinase (P < .05). Prolonged PT showed good discriminative value to differentiate acute abdomen patients with SIIH from AMI after abdominal CT, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.980 (95% confidence interval, 0.918-0.998; P < .0001). Prolonged PT cut-off value of â‰§22.5 seconds had a sensitivity of 92.9% and a specificity of 100%. Logistic regression analysis identified prolonged PT as an independent predictor of SIIH (odds ratio, OR, 22.2; P = .007).<br />CONCLUSION: Abdominal pain patients with either SIIH or AMI are rare in the ED, but abdominal CT sometimes cannot help to differentiate them due to similar CT findings. Prolonged PT might help emergency physicians and surgeons differentiate SIIH from AMI in such cases.","24051008","2013","11"

"461","Routine abdominal drainage versus no abdominal drainage for uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy.","The Cochrane database of systematic reviews","BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the main method of treatment of symptomatic gallstones. Drains are used after laparoscopic cholecystectomy to prevent abdominal collections. However, drain use may increase infective complications and delay discharge.<br />OBJECTIVES: The aim is to assess the benefits and harms of routine abdominal drainage in uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy.<br />SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded until February 2013.<br />SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomised clinical trials comparing drainage versus no drainage after uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy irrespective of language and publication status.<br />DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures defined by The Cochrane Collaboration.<br />MAIN RESULTS: A total of 1831 participants were randomised to drain (915 participants) versus 'no drain' (916 participants) in 12 trials included in this review. Only two trials including 199 participants were of low risk of bias. Nine trials included patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy exclusively. One trial included patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis exclusively. One trial included patients undergoing elective and emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and one trial did not provide this information. The average age of participants in the trials ranged between 48 years and 63 years in the 10 trials that provided this information. The proportion of females ranged between 55.0% and 79.0% in the 11 trials that provided this information. There was no significant difference between the drain group (1/840) (adjusted proportion: 0.1%) and the 'no drain' group (2/841) (0.2%) (RR 0.41; 95% CI 0.04 to 4.37) in short-term mortality in the ten trials with 1681 participants reporting on this outcome. There was no significant difference between the drain group (7/567) (adjusted proportion: 1.1%) and the 'no drain' group (3/576) (0.5%) in the proportion of patients who developed serious adverse events in the seven trials with 1143 participants reporting on this outcome (RR 2.12; 95% CI 0.67 to 7.40) or in the number of serious adverse events in each group reported by eight trials with 1286 participants; drain group (12/646) (adjusted rate: 1.5 events per 100 participants) versus 'no drain' group (6/640) (0.9 events per 100 participants); rate ratio 1.60; 95% CI 0.66 to 3.87). There was no significant difference in the quality of life between the two groups (one trial; 93 participants; SMD 0.22; 95% CI -0.19 to 0.63). The proportion of patients who were discharged as day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy seemed significantly lower in the drain group than the 'no drain' group (one trial; 68 participants; drain group (0/33) (adjusted proportion: 0.2%) versus 'no drain' group (11/35) (31.4%); RR 0.05; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.75). There was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay between the two groups (five trials; 449 participants; MD 0.22 days; 95% CI -0.06 days to 0.51 days). The operating time was significantly longer in the drain group than the 'no drain' group (seven trials; 775 participants; MD 5.00 minutes; 95% CI 2.69 minutes to 7.30 minutes). There was no significant difference in the return to normal activity and return to work between the groups in one trial involving 100 participants. This trial did not provide any information from which the standard deviation could be imputed and so the confidence intervals could not be calculated for these outcomes.<br />AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is currently no evidence to support the routine use of drain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Further well designed randomised clinical trials are necessary.","24000011","2013",\N
"462","[A case of gallbladder tuberculosis diagnosed by positive tuberculosis-polymerase chain reaction].","The Korean journal of gastroenterology = Taehan Sohwagi Hakhoe chi","Gallbladder tuberculosis is an extremely rare disease that is rarely reported in the literature. Arriving at the correct diagnosis of gallbladder tuberculosis is difficult, and it is usually made by histopathologic examination after cholecystectomy. However, due to the low sensitivity of acid-fast stain and culture result, diagnosing gallbladder tuberculosis is still demanding even after tissue acquisition. To overcome this problem, tuberculosis-polymerase chain reaction (TB-PCR) is performed on the resected specimen, which has high sensitivity and specificity. A 70-year-old female who had previously undergone total gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer was admitted with right upper quadrant pain. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed acute cholecystitis without gallstones or sludge. She underwent cholecystectomy and the histopathologic finding of the specimen showed chronic active cholecystitis without gallstones or sludge. Because she was suspected to have pulmonary tuberculosis, TB-PCR was also performed on the resected gallbladder. TB-PCR showed positive reaction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and we could diagnose it as gallbladder tuberculosis. Herein, we present a case of gallbladder tuberculosis diagnosed by TB-PCR from resected gallbladder.","24463290","2014","1"

"464","Risk-reducing laparoscopic cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy for low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm: early outcomes and technique.","Surgical endoscopy","BACKGROUND: Low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (LAMN) is a precursor lesion of pseudomyxoma peritonei, which, if treated suboptimally, may later disseminate throughout the abdominal cavity. We previously demonstrated the role of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) to reduce the dissemination risk. Here we describe the feasibility and safety of minimal access cytoreductive surgery (MACRS) and HIPEC as an alternative to the open approach.<br />METHODS: We evaluated patients with LAMNs at risk of dissemination (known as LAMN II) who were referred to a national treatment centre between 2010 and 2012 and comparison is made between this group and patients undergoing open CRS and HIPEC for the same pathology over the same time period.<br />RESULTS: Of the 39 patients with LAMN II, 10 patients were treated by MACRS and HIPEC and 7 were treated by an open approach. Among the MACRS procedures, there were no conversions to open surgery; median procedure length, median length of stay, and complication rates were similar between groups and there were no 30-day deaths. After 3- and 11-months median follow-up respectively, no patients have evidence of disease progression.<br />CONCLUSIONS: The present series demonstrates that MACRS and HIPEC is a feasible and safe alternative to the open procedure with the advantage of smaller abdominal wounds and comparable morbidity and inpatient stay. Longer follow-up is needed to assess the impact on disease progression.","24061624","2014","1"
"465","MDCT of acute cecal conditions.","Emergency radiology","The cecum comprises a relatively short segment of the gastrointestinal tract, but it can be affected by numerous acute conditions. Acute conditions may arise from processes primary to the cecum, such as volvulus, bascule, neoplasm, and trauma. Alternatively, acute conditions can be due to secondary to systemic or nearby pathology, such as infection, inflammatory processes, ischemia, and infarction. While it is common to suspect appendicitis as the etiology of acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain, the cecum should also be considered as a potential cause of pain, especially in the setting of an abnormal or absent appendix. Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) has evolved to become the best imaging modality to evaluate patients presenting with right lower quadrant abdominal pain or suspected acute cecal pathology. Strengths of MDCT include rapid acquisition of images, high spatial resolution, and ability to create multi-planar reconstructed images. In this pictorial review, we illustrate and describe key MDCT findings for various acute cecal conditions with which the emergency radiologist should be familiar.","24091866","2014","2"

The agreements between SMF-BIA and DXA for whole-body and appendicular body composition were assessed using simple linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis.<br />RESULTS: High coefficients of determination (R(2)) for whole-body FM (R(2)=0.94, s.e. of estimate (SEE)=1.2 kg), whole-body LM (R(2)=0.85, SEE=1.4 kg), and appendicular FM (R(2)=0.82, SEE=1.1 kg) were observed between SMF-BIA and DXA. The R(2) coefficient for appendicular LM was moderate (R(2)=0.76, SEE=0.8 kg). Bland-Altman plots demonstrated that there was systematic (constant) bias (that is, DXA minus SMF-BIA) with overestimation of whole-body FM (bias=-1.2 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI)=-1.5 to -0.1) and underestimation of whole-body LM (bias=2.1 kg, 95% CI=1.8-2.3) by SMF-BIA. Similar, the appendicular measurements also demonstrated systematic bias with overestimation of appendicular FM (bias=-0.3 kg, 95% CI=-0.5 to -0.1) and underestimation of whole-body LM (bias=1.5 kg, 95% CI=1.4-1.7) by SMF-BIA. In addition, the individual level accuracy demonstrated a non-proportional bias for whole-body LM (r=0.08, P=0.338) and appendicular FM (r=0.07, P=0.413).<br />CONCLUSIONS: SMF-BIA had acceptable accuracy for the estimation of whole-body and appendicular FM and LM in frail older women, although SMF-BIA underestimated LM and overestimated FM relative to DXA.","23388666","2013","4"

Accordingly, preoperative diagnosis of appendiceal cancer is challenging because of the lack of specific symptoms. We herein report a case of appendicular adenocarcinoma found unexpectedly during laparoscopic surgery in a 69-year-old Japanese female patient diagnosed with serous papillary adenocarcinoma, in order to determine whether optimal cytoreduction could successfully be achieved at the time of primary surgery. We performed diagnostic laparoscopic surgery in order to make a correct diagnosis based on the histological tissue. The vermiform appendix was found to contain a tumor measuring 1.5â€‰cm wide and 4.5â€‰cm long. Laparoscopic appendectomy, partial omentectomy, and partial resection of the lesion in the peritoneum were performed. The histological diagnosis was mucinous adenocarcinoma of the vermiform appendix, and the stage was T4NxM1. The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with mFOLFOX 6 (5FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin). She achieved stable disease and was alive with disease eleven months after surgery. We therefore recommend that gynecologists should not rule out the possibility of appendiceal cancer, even in cases with preoperative findings similar to those of serous papillary adenocarcinoma of the peritoneum with peritoneal disseminated tumors.","24383020","2013",\N

The aim was to present the diagnosis, treatment and potential complications of APP and symptomatic GBD. We searched the literature for APP and GBD during pregnancy and presented the results in the form of a review article. APP symptoms among pregnant women are comparable to these in the general population. Typical clinical symptoms are present in 50-75% of cases. Laboratory tests are useful for a differential diagnosis. The imaging of choice is an ultrasonography scan, but magnetic resonance is of the highest accuracy The final diagnosis is difficult. When the surgery is delayed, the risk of appendix perforation increases and thus complications are more frequent. GBD symptoms and signs are comparable to those in the general population. The best imaging is an ultrasonography scan, and laboratory tests are important in a jaundice differential diagnosis. In cases with symptomatic GBD, a delay in surgery is associated with an increased risk of complications (pancreatitis, abortion, intrauterine death). The treatment method of choice for APP and symptomatic GBD is surgery both laparotomy and laparoscopy (preferred), which are considered relatively safe, though laparoscopy compared to laparotomy for APP can be associated with a higher risk of abortion. Untreated or delayed APP and symptomatic GBD treatment during pregnancy increases the risk of complications, both for the woman and the fetus. Diagnosis is difficult and should be based on a multidisciplinary approach to the patient. Surgery by laparotomy or laparoscopy is relatively safe.","24505953","2013","12"

The obvious rarity of this condition, its subtle diagnostic features and dissonant previous reporting about the appropriate therapeutic approach according to age, future conception capacity and potential complications of possible pregnancies make the decision about which surgical approach to use very difficult. In this report, we describe the case of a patient with such a presentation and review the literature. Very few similar reports of neosalpingostomy in pediatric patients have been published to date.<br />CASE PRESENTATION: In our present report, we describe the case of an 11-year-old Caucasian prepubertal girl who presented to our hospital with complaints of abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant, nausea and vomiting. The diagnostic workup led us to conclude that she had a torsion of the right ovary, which was cystically altered. Exploratory surgery revealed a partial hydrosalpinx and consecutive isolated torsion of the fimbrial part. The proximal isthmic part of the fallopian tube was intact and vital. Restorative surgery was performed to create a neosalpingostomy on the viable isthmic part of the tube and remove the cystic and twisted fimbrial and infundibular parts.<br />CONCLUSION: The surgical procedure described in this report is technically simple and feasible, but leaves doubts about the final outcome.","24939319","2014",\N

In a phase 1 study, idelalisib, an orally active selective PI3KÎ´ inhibitor, showed antitumor activity in patients with previously treated indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.<br />METHODS: In this single-group, open-label, phase 2 study, 125 patients with indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphomas who had not had a response to rituximab and an alkylating agent or had had a relapse within 6 months after receipt of those therapies were administered idelalisib, 150 mg twice daily, until the disease progressed or the patient withdrew from the study. The primary end point was the overall rate of response; secondary end points included the duration of response, progression-free survival, and safety.<br />RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 64 years (range, 33 to 87); patients had received a median of four prior therapies (range, 2 to 12). Subtypes of indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma included follicular lymphoma (72 patients), small lymphocytic lymphoma (28), marginal-zone lymphoma (15), and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma with or without WaldenstrÃ¶m's macroglobulinemia (10). The response rate was 57% (71 of 125 patients), with 6% meeting the criteria for a complete response. The median time to a response was 1.9 months, the median duration of response was 12.5 months, and the median progression-free survival was 11 months. Similar response rates were observed across all subtypes of indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, though the numbers were small for some categories. The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were neutropenia (in 27% of the patients), elevations in aminotransferase levels (in 13%), diarrhea (in 13%), and pneumonia (in 7%).<br />CONCLUSIONS: In this single-group study, idelalisib showed antitumor activity with an acceptable safety profile in patients with indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who had received extensive prior treatment.

"473","Early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute gallstone pancreatitis.","The Cochrane database of systematic reviews","BACKGROUND: Gallstones and alcohol account for more than 80% of acute pancreatitis. Cholecystectomy is the definitive treatment for gallstones. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the preferred route for performing cholecystectomy. The timing of laparoscopic cholecystectomy after an attack of acute biliary pancreatitis is controversial.<br />OBJECTIVES: To compare the benefits and harms of early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy in people with acute biliary pancreatitis. For mild acute pancreatitis, we considered 'early' laparoscopic cholecystectomy to be laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed within three days of onset of symptoms. We considered all laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed beyond three days of onset of symptoms as 'delayed'. For severe acute pancreatitis, we considered 'early' laparoscopic cholecystectomy as laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed within the index admission. We considered all laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed in a later admission as 'delayed'.<br />SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane LibraryÂ 2012, issue 12), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and trial registers until January 2013.<br />SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials, irrespective of language or publication status, comparing early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for people with acute biliary pancreatitis.<br />DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and independently extracted data. We planned to analyse data with both the fixed-effect and the random-effects models using Review Manager 5 (RevMan 2011). We calculated the risk ratio (RR), or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on an intention-to-treat analysis.<br />MAIN RESULTS: We identified one trial comparing early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for people with mild acute pancreatitis. Fifty participants with mild acute gallstone pancreatitis were randomised either to early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (within 48 hours of admission irrespective of whether the abdominal symptoms were resolved or the laboratory values had returned to normal) (n = 25), or to delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (surgery after resolution of abdominal pain and after the laboratory values had returned to normal) (n = 25). This trial is at high risk of bias. There was no short-term mortality in either group. There was no significant difference between the groups in the proportion of participants who developed serious adverse events (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.01 to 7.81). Health-related quality of life was not reported in this trial. There were no conversions to open cholecystectomy in either group. The total hospital stay was significantly shorter in the early laparoscopic cholecystectomy group than in the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group (MD -2.30 days; 95% CI -4.40 to -0.20). This trial reported neither the number of work-days lost nor the costs. We did not identify any trials comparing early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy after severe acute pancreatitis.<br />AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence of increased risk of complications after early laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy may shorten the total hospital stay in people with mild acute pancreatitis. If appropriate facilities and expertise are available, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy appears preferable to delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy in those with mild acute pancreatitis. There is currently no evidence to support or refute early laparoscopic cholecystectomy for people with severe acute pancreatitis. Further randomised controlled trials at low risk of bias are necessary in people with mild acute pancreatitis and severe acute pancreatitis.","23996398","2013",\N
"474","Laparoscopic partially extraperitoneal (PEP) mesh repair for laterally placed ventral and incisional hernias.","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques","Laparoscopic mesh repair is becoming an increasingly popular method of ventral and incisional hernia repair. Entrapment neuropathy is a recognised complication when tacks are used to fix the mesh, particularly below the inguinal ligament and laterally in the abdominal wall. We describe a novel method of ventral hernia repair, which employs transabdominal extra-peritoneal dissection to create a pocket for mesh placement with complete avoidance of tacks in the postero-lateral abdominal wall. This technique is particularly useful for incisional hernias arising through old stoma wounds or appendicectomy incisions, and for Spigelian and lumbar hernias.","24710242","2014","6"
"475","Laparoscopic surgery for benign and malign diseases of the digestive system: indications, limitations, and evidence.","World journal of gastroenterology : WJG","The laparoscopic technique was introduced in gastrointestinal surgery in the mid 1980s. Since then, the development of this technique has been extraordinary. Triggered by technical innovations (stapling devices or coagulation/dissecting devices), nowadays any type of gastrointestinal resection has been successfully performed laparoscopically and can be performed laparoscopically dependent on the patient's condition. This summary gives an overview over 30 years of laparoscopic surgery with focus on today's indications and evidence. Main indications remain the more common procedures, e.g., appendectomy, cholecystectomy, bariatric procedures or colorectal resections. For all these indications, the laparoscopic approach has become the gold standard with less perioperative morbidity. Regarding oncological outcome there have been several high-quality randomized controlled trials which demonstrated equivalency between laparoscopic and open colorectal resections. Less common procedures like esophagectomy, oncological gastrectomy, liver and pancreatic resections can be performed successfully as well by an experienced surgeon. However, the evidence for these special indications is poor and a general recommendation cannot be given. In conclusion, laparoscopic surgery has revolutionized the field of gastrointestinal surgery by reducing perioperative morbidity without disregarding surgical principles especially in oncological surgery.","24803799","2014","5"

Few case reports have been published; most describe the formation of a fistula after appendicitis. Here we describe the case of a 79-year-old woman presenting with an appendico-cutaneous fistula after groin hernia repair. She was referred to our outpatient department with a painful mass in the right groin. An ultrasound showed a fluid containing mass. Incision and drainage was performed. After 9 weeks she was referred again with a persisting open wound. Fistulogram and CT scan showed a fistuleous tract involving the appendix. Wound culture showed Escherichia coli. Diagnostic laparoscopy showed an appendix stuck to the ventral wall of the abdomen without any sign of previous infection. After an appendectomy, pathological investigation revealed an appendix sana. After operation, the fistula persisted due to a polypropylene plug from the previous groin hernia correction. The (infected) plug was removed and the fistula healed.","23921697","2013",\N

Using published amino acid sequences of other vertebrate species (human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, cow, pig, chicken and dog), we constructed a phylogenetic tree which showed that equine VEGFÎ± belonged to the same clade of the pig VEGFÎ±. Analysis for synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous substitution ratios (Ka) revealed that the horse VEGFÎ± underwent positive selection. RNA was extracted from blood samples before and after exercise and different tissue samples of three horses. Expression analyses using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) showed ubiquitous expression of VEGFÎ± mRNA in skeletal muscle, kidney, thyroid, lung, appendix, colon, spinal cord, and heart tissues. Analysis of differential expression of VEGFÎ± gene in blood leukocytes after exercise indicated a unimodal pattern. These results will be useful in developing biomarkers that can predict the recovery capacity of racing horses.","25050010","2014","5"

The guiding principles are the need for secure, inert closure of the appendiceal base without injury to the appendiceal stump or cecum, with minimal risks of complication attributable to the closure technique. Safety and complication rates, as well as cost data, should guide the techniques used for pediatric laparoscopic appendectomy. Based on the literature available there is not a clear answer as to the best method for closing the appendiceal stump in pediatric patients, with each of the methods described providing safe closure.

The diagnostic criteria currently used (pH and base deficit or lactatemia) are imprecise and non-specific.<br />OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to determine among a low-risk cohort of infants born at term (n = 867), the best diagnostic tool of metabolic acidosis in the cordonal from the following parameters: pH, blood gases and lactate values at birth.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data were obtained from arterial blood of the umbilical cord by a blood gas analyser. The parameter best predicting metabolic analysis was estimated from the partial correlations established between the most relevant parameters.<br />RESULTS: The results showed a slight change in all parameters compared to adult values: acidemia (pH: 7.28 Â± 0.01), hypercapnia (56.5 Â± 1.59 mmHg) and hyperlactatemia (3.4 Â± 0.05 mmol/L). From partial correlation analysis, pCO(2) emerged to be the main contributor of acidemia, while lactatemia was shown to be non-specific for metabolic acidosis. Seven cases (0.81 %) showed a pH less than 7.00 with marked hypercapnia. The correction of this respiratory component by EISENBERG's method led to the eucapnic pH, classifying six out of seven cases as exclusive respiratory acidosis.<br />DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: It has been demonstrated that the criteria from ACOG-AAP for defining a metabolic acidosis are incomplete, imprecise and generating errors in excess. The same is true for lactatemia, whose physiological significance has been completely revised, challenging the misconception of lactic acidosis as a specific marker of hypoxia. It appeared that eucapnic pH was the best way for obtaining a reliable diagnosis of metabolic acidosis. We proposed to adopt a simple decision scheme for determining whether a metabolic acidosis has occurred in case of acidemia less than 7.00.","23988472","2013","9"

She had a history of cesarean delivery for abruption after the removal of a Shirodkar cerclage that was placed because of cervical shortening caused by conization. She became pregnant again 14 months later. Ultrasonography revealed no significant findings, and a single intrauterine pregnancy with positive fetal heart activity was confirmed. An intestinal obstruction was suspected because abdominal radiography showed multiple air-fluid levels in the colon. Over the 3 hours following admission, her symptoms gradually worsened, and plain abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a large hemorrhage in the abdominal cavity, but the uterine wall appeared intact at this time. Subsequently, dynamic CT revealed discontinuity of the uterine muscle layer. During laparotomy, uterine rupture with complete opening of the uterine wall at the site of the previous transverse scar was identified. A dead fetus was located within the amniotic sac in a blood-filled abdominal cavity. She received a total of 10 units of packed red blood cells and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma for the resuscitation.

The etiology is unclear and its description in the literature is sparse, but associations have been made with collagen vascular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, food allergy and parasitic infections as it was confirmed in one of our pathologic studies.<br />CLINICAL CASES: From 1997 to 2011 six cases of eosinophilic enteritis that involved a small bowel segment were diagnosed. A partial resection by an irreversible necrosis was necessary in three of them; in the other three only a biopsy was necessary due to the inflammatory aspect of the affected loop causing the acute abdomen.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Eosinophilic enteritis can originate acute abdomen processes where an urgent surgical treatment is necessary. The intraoperative aspect can be from a segment of small bowel with inflammatory signs up to a completely irrecoverable loop, where removing of the affected segment is the correct treatment, which can be done laparoscopically.","23769255",\N,\N

She was also complaining of breathlessness on exertion and right-sided pleuritic chest pain for the past one year. Her chest X-ray showed well defined consolidation in the right lower lobe of the lung with pleural effusion. Further pleural tap showed malignant cells with squamous differentiation. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) from breast lumps was suggestive of malignant cells with morphology of cells likely to be squamous. CT-guided biopsy of the lung mass showed moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. She succumbed to her illness following severe respiratory distress.

The diagnostic workup was inconclusive. Emergency surgery was indicated with a suspicion of acute appendicitis. We found a strangulated ileus caused by an internal herniation of the small intestine through a hole in the greater omentum. The patient had no history of surgery or other physical disorders explaining this finding. The obstruction was resolved and the postoperative clinical course was uncomplicated.<br />DISCUSSION: A thorough diagnostic workup including CT scan would most probably have given the correct diagnosis. However, the clinical course and initiation of the correct treatment would have been delayed significantly.<br />CONCLUSION: We suggest that the diagnostic workup of patients with unclear lower abdominal pain should be limited and that acute clinical symptoms require rapid laparoscopic evaluation and surgical treatment.","24291681","2013",\N

Participants were allocated to 2 groups; a regular exercise group (male, 2; female, 15) with a mean (SD) age of 35.8 (9.1) years and intervention group (male, 3; female, 13) with a mean (SD) age of 36.2 (9.8) years. The regular exercise group received exercise that consisted of a core stability class including both specific and global trunk exercises. The intervention group, in addition to these core exercises, received further instruction on 8 specific stabilization muscles involving the transversus abdominis and the lumbar multifidus. Trunk sagittal acceleration, pain, and disability were measured using a Lumbar Motion Monitor, pain visual analog scale, and Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, respectively. Measures were taken at baseline, 3 and 6 weeks, and a 3-month follow-up. Multiple regression with adjustment for baseline value was used to analyze each outcome. All outcomes were log transformed to correct skewness and so presented as ratio of geometric means with 95% confidence interval.<br />RESULTS: Differences in mean trunk sagittal acceleration between the regular exercise and intervention groups was not statistically significant at any time point (ratio of means [95% confidence interval]: 3 weeks 1.2 [0.9-1.6], P = .2; 6 weeks 1.1 [0.8-1.5], P = .7; 3 months: 1.2 [0.8-1.9], P = .9). Similarly, the effects on neither pain score nor disability score were significant (pain score: 3 weeks 1.3 [0.8-2.2], P = .3); 6 weeks 1.2 [0.7-2.0], P = .6; 3 months 1.0 [0.5-1.9], P = 1.0); disability score: 6 weeks 1.0 [0.7-1.5], P = 1.0; 3 months 1.3 [0.8-1.9], P = .3). Outcome measures for both groups improved over time.<br />CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrated that a study of this nature is feasible. Both the regular exercise and the intervention groups demonstrated improvements in mean trunk sagittal acceleration at 3, 6, and 12 weeks. The preliminary findings showed that evidence was inconclusive for the beneficial effect of adding specific core stability exercises for acute low back pain. The results of this study demonstrated an increase in acceleration accompanied by a reduction in pain, which may suggest that acute nonspecific low back pain may induce the pain-spasm-pain model rather than the pain adaptation model.","23948426","2013","10"

The FH device utilizes preferential hyperacuity perimetry and tele-monitoring to detect changes in vision function associated with development of CNV, potentially prior to symptom and visual acuity loss. After establishing baseline measurements, subsequent changes on follow-up are detected by the device, causing the monitoring center to alert the clinical center to recall participants for an exam. Standard care consists of instructions for self-monitoring visual changes with subsequent self-report to the clinical center. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether home monitoring plus standard care in comparison with standard care alone, results in earlier detection of incident CNV with better present visual acuity. The primary outcome is the decline in visual acuity at CNV diagnosis from baseline. Detection of CNV prior to substantial vision loss is critical as vision outcome following anti-angiogenic therapy is dependent on the visual acuity at initiation of treatment.<br />DISCUSSION: HOME Study is the first large scale study to test the use of home tele-monitoring system in the management of AMD patients.","24530651","2014","3"

None of the patients had received prior treatment that had affected the bone marrow and patients with bone metastases, trauma, benign and/or malignant hematologic disorders were excluded from the study. The SUVmax from the 24 different locations in the skeleton was obtained and all the values were compared with each other.<br />RESULTS: FDG uptake in the skeleton was not uniform in both sexes. While the highest FDG uptake was seen in the L3 vertebra, the lowest glucose metabolism was observed in the diaphysis of the femur. Concerning the vertebral column, FDG uptakes were also non-uniform and the SUVmax gradually increased from the cervix to the lumbar spine. The mean skeletal SUVmax was decreased in accordance with age in both genders.<br />CONCLUSION: FDG was not uniformly distributed throughout the skeleton in both sexes. It had a tendency to increase from the appendicular to axial skeleton and from cervical to lumbar spine in the vertebral column that may be related with the normal distribution of the red bone marrow. Additionally, the glycolytic metabolism of the whole skeleton was gradually decreased in accordance with the age in both sexes.","24950889",\N,\N

A diagnosis of ischaemic colitis was made by the computed tomography (CT) scan findings of colonic thickening and pneumatosis, in addition to colonoscopy demonstrating sloughy mucosa and ulceration. Symptoms did not resolve with conservative management, therefore laparotomy+Hartmann's procedure was performed. Histology showed extensive areas of both partial and full thickness ischaemia with stricture.<br />DISCUSSION: Amylase is an indicator of intra-abdominal inflammatory processes. Hyperamylasaemia (normal <100U/l) is most frequently associated with pancreatitis; however, causation is not exclusive and other differentials including bowel ischaemia must be considered, although amylase is not a specific marker for ischaemic colitis.

"495","Laparoscopy in the era of enhanced recovery.","Best practice & research. Clinical gastroenterology","Laparoscopy is one of the cornerstones in the surgical revolution and transformed outcome and recovery for various surgical procedures. Even if these changes were widely accepted for basic interventions, like appendectomies and cholecystectomies, laparoscopy still remains challenged for more advanced operations in many aspects. Despite these discussion, there is an overwhelming acceptance in the surgical community that laparoscopy did transform the recovery for several abdominal procedures. The importance of improved peri-operative patient management and its influence on outcome started to become a focus of attention 20 years ago and is now increasingly spreading, as shown by the incoming volume of data on this topic. The enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) concept incorporates simple measures of general management, and requires multidisciplinary collaboration from hospital staff as well as the patient and the relatives. Several studies have demonstrated a significant decrease in postoperative complication rate, length of hospital stay and reduced overall cost. The key elements of success are fluid restriction, a functioning epidural and preoperative carbohydrate intake. With the expansion of laparoscopic techniques, ERAS increasingly incorporates laparoscopic patients, especially in colorectal surgery. However, the precise impact of laparoscopy on ERAS is still not clearly defined. Increasing evidence suggests that laparoscopy itself is an additional ERAS item that should be considered as routine where feasible in order to obtain the best surgical outcomes.","24485261","2014","2"

When acute cholecystitis is suspected in patients with right upper quadrant pain, in most clinical scenarios, the initial imaging modality of choice is ultrasound. Although cholescintigraphy has been shown to have slightly higher sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis, ultrasound is preferred as the initial study for a variety of reasons, including greater availability, shorter examination time, lack of ionizing radiation, morphologic evaluation, confirmation of the presence or absence of gallstones, evaluation of bile ducts, and identification or exclusion of alternative diagnoses. CT or MRI may be helpful in equivocal cases and may identify complications of acute cholecystitis. When ultrasound findings are inconclusive, MRI is the preferred imaging test in pregnant patients who present with right upper quadrant pain. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel.

Eligible patients had right ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography or computed tomography, as well as myocardial injury as indicated by a positive test for cardiac troponin I or troponin T. The primary outcome was death or hemodynamic decompensation (or collapse) within 7 days after randomization. The main safety outcomes were major extracranial bleeding and ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke within 7 days after randomization.<br />RESULTS: Of 1006 patients who underwent randomization, 1005 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Death or hemodynamic decompensation occurred in 13 of 506 patients (2.6%) in the tenecteplase group as compared with 28 of 499 (5.6%) in the placebo group (odds ratio, 0.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.23 to 0.87; P=0.02).

"502","Incidence, predictors, and outcome of difficult mask ventilation combined with difficult laryngoscopy: a report from the multicenter perioperative outcomes group.","Anesthesiology","BACKGROUND: Research regarding difficult mask ventilation (DMV) combined with difficult laryngoscopy (DL) is extremely limited even though each technique serves as a rescue for one another.<br />METHODS: Four tertiary care centers participating in the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group used a consistent structured patient history and airway examination and airway outcome definition. DMV was defined as grade 3 or 4 mask ventilation, and DL was defined as grade 3 or 4 laryngoscopic view or four or more intubation attempts. The primary outcome was DMV combined with DL. Patients with the primary outcome were compared to those without the primary outcome to identify predictors of DMV combined with DL using a non-parsimonious logistic regression.<br />RESULTS: Of 492,239 cases performed at four institutions among adult patients, 176,679 included a documented face mask ventilation and laryngoscopy attempt. Six hundred ninety-eight patients experienced the primary outcome, an overall incidence of 0.40%. One patient required an emergent cricothyrotomy, 177 were intubated using direct laryngoscopy, 284 using direct laryngoscopy with bougie introducer, 163 using videolaryngoscopy, and 73 using other techniques. Independent predictors of the primary outcome included age 46 yr or more, body mass index 30 or more, male sex, Mallampati III or IV, neck mass or radiation, limited thyromental distance, sleep apnea, presence of teeth, beard, thick neck, limited cervical spine mobility, and limited jaw protrusion (c-statistic 0.84 [95% CI, 0.82-0.87]).<br />CONCLUSION: DMV combined with DL is an infrequent but not rare phenomenon. Most patients can be managed with the use of direct or videolaryngoscopy. An easy to use unweighted risk scale has robust discriminating capacity.","24071617","2013","12"

Its incidence has increased in the last 30 years, and although its morbimortality has decreased, it is still the first cause of mortality in the first trimester of the pregnancy. Early suspicion is important, particularly in women of fertile age and with risk factors indicative of an extrauterine gestation. The symptomatology is usually amenorrhea, abdominal pain, metrorrhagia, general pregnancy symptoms, and even syncope and shock. The diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is based on the clinical information, analytical results on mother blood and urine, ultrasound examination, transvaginal culdocentesis, laparoscopic or laparotomic inspection, and a histological study. The treatment can be surgical (salpingostomy or salpingectomy), medical (methotrexate) or expectant, depending on the factors of the ectopic pregnancy: early diagnosis, presence of acute complications, clinical condition of the patient, etc.","24529529",\N,\N

Currently, promising treatment options are available for selected patients with PM from colorectal, appendiceal, ovarian or gastric carcinoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence, treatment and survival of patients presenting with PM in whom the origin of PM remains unknown.<br />METHODS: Data from patients diagnosed with PM of unknown origin during 1984-2010 were extracted from the Eindhoven Cancer Registry. European age-standardised incidence rates were calculated and data on treatment and survival were analysed.<br />RESULTS: In total 1051 patients were diagnosed with PM of unknown origin. In 606 patients (58%) the peritoneum was the only site of metastasis, and 445 patients also had other metastases. Chemotherapy usage has increased from 8% in the earliest period to 16% in most recent years (p=.016). Median survival was extremely poor with only 42days (95% confidence interval (CI) 39-47days) and did not change over time. Median survival of patients not receiving chemotherapy was significantly worse than of those receiving chemotherapy (36 versus 218days, p<.0001).<br />CONCLUSION: The prognosis of PM of unknown origin is extremely poor and did not improve over time. Given the recent progress that has been achieved in selected patients presenting with PM, maximum efforts should be undertaken in order to diagnose the origin of PM as accurately as possible. Potentially effective treatment strategies should be further explored for patients in whom the organ of origin remains unknown.","24011935","2014","1"

CT images of 32 women with clinically proven acute PID and 32 control subjects with other conditions of similar presentation were retrospectively reviewed. Analysis of CT findings included hepatic capsular enhancement, pelvic fat haziness, complicated ascites, uterine serosal enhancement, tubal thickening, endometritis, and oophoritis. Comparison of CT findings was performed with the Chi square test or the Fisher exact test and logistic regression analysis was used to determine significant CT findings in predicting PID.<br />RESULTS: The CT findings that showed a statistically significant difference were hepatic capsular enhancement on late arterial phase (pÂ =Â 0.003), pelvic fat haziness (pÂ =Â 0.045), and tubal thickening (pÂ =Â 0.001). Subsequent multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the presence of hepatic capsular enhancement on late arterial phase and tubal thickening were significant predictors of PID (hepatic capsular enhancement on late arterial phase, pÂ =Â 0.015, odds ratio [OR]Â =Â 4.8; tubal thickening, pÂ =Â 0.005, ORÂ =Â 10.5).<br />CONCLUSION: Diagnostic morphological CT findings in women with clinically proven PID and acute abdominal pain include hepatic capsular enhancement on late arterial phase and tubal thickening.","24802548","2014","12"
"506","Current pediatric rheumatology fellowship training in the United States: what fellows actually do.","Pediatric rheumatology online journal","BACKGROUND: Pediatric Rheumatology (PR) training in the US has existed since the 1970's. In the early 1990's, the training was formalized into a three year training program by the American College of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and American Board of Pediatrics (ABP). Programs have been evaluated every 5Â years by the ACGME to remain credentialed and graduates had to pass a written exam to be certified. There has been no report yet that details not just what training fellows should receive in the 32 US PR training programs but what training the trainees are actually receiving.<br />METHODS: After a literature search, a survey was constructed by the authors, then reviewed and revised with the help members of the Executive Committee of the Rheumatology Section of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) using the Delphi technique. IRB approval was obtained from the AAP and Nationwide Children's Hospital. The list of fellows was obtained from the ABP and the survey sent out to 81 current fellows or fellows just having finished. One repeat e-mail was sent out.<br />RESULTS: Forty-seven fellows returned the survey by e-mail (58%) with the majority being 3rd year fellows or fellows who had completed their training. The demographics were as expected with femalesâ€‰>â€‰males and Caucasians>â€‰>â€‰non-Caucasians. Training appeared quite appropriate in the number of Â½â€‰day continuity clinics per week (1-2, 71%), number of patients per clinic (4-5, 60%), inpatient exposure (2-4 inpatients per week, 40%; 5 or greater, 33%), and weekday/weekend call. Fellows attended more didactic activities than required, had ample time for research (54% 21-60/hours per week), and had multiple teaching opportunities. Seventy-seven percent of the trainees presented abstracts at national meetings, 41% had publication. Disease exposure was excellent and joint injection experience sufficient.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Most US PR training programs as a whole provide an appropriate training by current ACGME, American College of Rheumatology (ACR), and ABP standards in: 1) number of continuity clinics; 2) sufficient on-call activities for weekday nights and weekends; 3) joint interdisciplinary conferences; 4) electives 5) didactic activities; 6) scholarly activities; and 7) exposure to diverse rheumatology diseases. Areas of concern were uniformity & standardization of training, need for a customized PR training curriculum, more mentorship, free electives, training in musculoskeletal ultrasound, need for a hands-on OSCE certification exam and more exposure to ACGME competencies.","24507769","2014",\N

No study of the association of sarcopenia with insulin resistance, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome (MS) according to age group and obesity status in the general population has been reported. We investigated these associations in the Korean population. Participants included 4558 males and 5874 females, who were â‰¥20 years of age or older from the fourth and fifth Korea National Health and Nutritional Examination Surveys of the Korean population (2009 and 2010). Age was categorized according to three groups (20-39, 40-59, and â‰¥ 60 years). Obesity was defined according to body mass index. Sarcopenia was defined as the appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) divided by weight (Wt) (%) of > 2SD below the sex-specific mean for young adults. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated. After adjustment for confounding variables, sarcopenia showed a significant association with HOMA-IR in the non-obese group (P<0.001). Sarcopenia was found to be a risk factor for diabetes in the non-obese group (OR, 2.140; 95% CI, 1.549-2.956; P<0.001). Sarcopenia also showed an association with MS in the non-obese group (OR, 2.209; 95% CI, 1.679-2.906; P<0.001), but not in the obese-group. However, these results were not relevant to young age group. In conclusion, sarcopenia showed an association with insulin resistance, diabetes, and MS, in the non-obese population. Sarcopenia may be an early predictor for diabetes and MS susceptibility in the non-obese population, particularly in elderly people.","24088600","2014",\N
"509","Hemoperitoneum from corpus luteal cyst rupture: a practical approach in emergency room.","Case reports in emergency medicine","Corpus luteum cyst rupture with consequent hemoperitoneum is a common disorder in women in their reproductive age. This condition should be promptly recognized and treated because a delayed diagnosis may significantly reduce women's fertility and intra-abdominal bleeding may be life-threatening. Many imaging modalities play a key role in the diagnosis of acute pelvic pain from gynecological causes. Ultrasound study (USS) is usually the first imaging technique for initial evaluation. USS is used to confirm or to exclude the presence of intraperitoneal fluid but it has some limitations in the identification of the bleeding source. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) is the imaging modality which could be used in the acute setting in order to recognize gynecological emergencies and to establish a correct management. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) nowadays is the most useful technique for studying the pelvis but its low availability and the long acquisition time of the images limit its usefulness in characterization of acute gynecological complications. We report a case of a young patient with hemoperitoneum from hemorrhagic corpus luteum correctly identified by transabdominal USS and contrast-enhanced CT.","24987535","2014",\N

A seven year old male patient with WASP, began with acute abdominal pain, fever and knee swelling. The diagnosis of septic arthritis was made, and he was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and human gammaglobulin. During treatment he presented digestive tract bleeding with hypovolemic shock; after 72 hours palpable purpura in upper and lower extremities appeared. Then Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein purpura with abdominal vasculitis was suspected, and later confirmed by histopathology. Methylprednisolone pulses were initiated, showing improvement within 24 hours. The patient had a severe inflammatory reaction, caused by a serious infectious disease, but the clinical evolution suggested an autoimmune disease such as Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein purpura. Up to 20% of patients with WAS have autoimmune manifestations of vasculitis. An early diagnosis of autoimmunity in WAS is important for a favorable clinical outcome.","24007933",\N,\N

The contribution of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PTX3 to the development of invasive aspergillosis is unknown.<br />METHODS: We screened an initial cohort of 268 patients undergoing hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) and their donors for PTX3 SNPs modifying the risk of invasive aspergillosis. The analysis was also performed in a multicenter study involving 107 patients with invasive aspergillosis and 223 matched controls. The functional consequences of PTX3 SNPs were investigated in vitro and in lung specimens from transplant recipients.<br />RESULTS: Receipt of a transplant from a donor with a homozygous haplotype (h2/h2) in PTX3 was associated with an increased risk of infection, in both the discovery study (cumulative incidence, 37% vs. 15%; adjusted hazard ratio, 3.08; P=0.003) and the confirmation study (adjusted odds ratio, 2.78; P=0.03), as well as with defective expression of PTX3. Functionally, PTX3 deficiency in h2/h2 neutrophils, presumably due to messenger RNA instability, led to impaired phagocytosis and clearance of the fungus.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Genetic deficiency of PTX3 affects the antifungal capacity of neutrophils and may contribute to the risk of invasive aspergillosis in patients treated with HSCT.

The aim of the present study was to assess longitudinal relationships between baseline androgen and muscle mass changes in Japanese women.<br />METHODS: Data were collected from 539 community-dwelling, Japanese women aged 40-79â€‰years at baseline who participated in both baseline and follow-up examinations of a longitudinal study of aging (mean duration 8.3â€‰years). Appendicular skeletal muscle mass was measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at baseline and follow-up examinations. The cut-off point for sarcopenia was a skeletal muscle index (appendicular skeletal muscle mass/height(2) ) <5.46â€‰kg/m(2) . Participants with sarcopenia at baseline were excluded. Thus, 430 women were included. Total testosterone, free testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate were measured by radioimmunoassay at baseline. The androgens were categorized into three groups by serum levels. Multiple logistic regression models were fit to determine the associations between androgens and sarcopenia while controlling for baseline age, body mass index, leisure-time physical activity, nutritional intakes (total energy, total protein, vitaminâ€‰D), serum C-reactive protein levels, medical histories (heart disease, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis), menopause and smoking habit.<br />RESULTS: The fully adjusted odds ratio of sarcopenia for the low-free testosterone group (<0.7â€‰pg/mL) compared with the high-free testosterone group (â‰¥1.2â€‰pg/mL) was 3.59 (95% confidence interval 1.25-10.34).

"513","Site selectivity for protein tyrosine nitration: insights from features of structure and topological network.","Molecular bioSystems","Tyrosine nitration is a covalent post-translational modification, which regulates protein functions such as hindering tyrosine phosphorylation and affecting essential signal transductions in cells. Based on up-to-date proteomics data, tyrosine nitration appears to be a highly selective process since not all tyrosine residues in proteins or all proteins are nitrated in vivo. Quite a few investigations included the protein structural information from the RCSB PDB database, where near 100,000 high-quality three-dimensional structures are available. In this work, we analyzed the local protein structures and amino acid topological networks of the nitrated and non-nitrated tyrosine sites in nitrated proteins, including neighboring atomic distribution, amino acid pair (AAP) and amino acid triangle (AAT). It has been found that aromatic and aliphatic residues, particularly with large volume, aromatic, aliphatic, or acidic side chains, are disfavored for the nitration. After integrating these structural features and topological network features with traditional sequence features, the predictive model achieves a sensitivity of 63.30% and a specificity of 92.24%, resulting in a much better accuracy compared to the previous models with only protein sequence information. Our investigation implies that the site selectivity may stem from a more open, hydrophilic and high-pH chemical environment around the tyrosine residue.","24056708","2013","11"

The mechanisms underlying this association remain uncertain.<br />OBJECTIVES: To determine if real-life exposures to AAP are associated with suppressed IgM antibody responses to P. jirovecii in HIV-infected (HIV+) patients with active PCP, and to determine if AAP, mediated by suppressed serologic responses to Pneumocystis, is associated with adverse clinical outcomes.<br />METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study in HIV+ patients residing in San Francisco and admitted to San Francisco General Hospital with microscopically confirmed PCP. Our AAP predictors were ambient air concentrations of particulate matter of < 10 Âµm in diameter (PM10) and < 2.5 Âµm in diameter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) measured immediately prior to hospital admission and 2 weeks prior to admission. Our primary outcomes were the IgM serologic responses to four recombinant P. jirovecii major surface glycoprotein (Msg) constructs: MsgC1, MsgC3, MsgC8, and MsgC9.<br />RESULTS: Elevated PM10 and NO2 exposures immediately prior to and two weeks prior to hospital admission were associated with decreased IgM antibody responses to P. jirovecii Msg. For exposures immediately prior to admission, every 10 Âµg/m(3) increase in PM10 was associated with a 25 to 35% decrease in IgM responses to Msg (statistically significant for all the Msg constructs), and every 10 ppb increase in NO2 was associated with a 19-45% decrease in IgM responses to Msg (statistically significant for MsgC8 and MsgC9). Similar findings were seen with exposures two weeks prior to admission, but for fewer of the Msg constructs.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Real life exposures to PM10 and NO2 were associated with suppressed IgM responses to P. jirovecii Msg in HIV+ patients admitted with PCP, suggesting a mechanism of immunotoxicity by which AAP increases host susceptibility to pulmonary infection.","24236202","2013",\N

MRI findings were compared with surgery as the reference standard. The difference of tear type and displacement of torn meniscus between children and adults in arthroscopic finding was analyzed using the Fisher's exact test or the Chi-squared test with Bonferroni's correction.<br />RESULTS: At arthroscopy, complex tear (children, n = 22; adults, n = 56) and peripheral tear (children, n = 17; adults, n = 8) differed significantly between children and adults (P = 0.006 for complex tear, P = 0.002 for peripheral tear). Displacement of torn meniscus was seen in 28 cases of children and 41 cases of adults, not a statistically significant difference. In children, the positive predictive value (PPV) for horizontal tears was 90%, for peripheral tears 60%, and for complex tears 57%.

The superiority of sacculus rotundus over other tissues is its unique mechanical properties as well as its abundant collagen content.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: The acellular matrix of vermiform appendix underwent different laboratory investigations prior to transplantation. We divided 12 rabbits into 3 groups: group I underwent bladder augmentation cystoplasty by detubularized acellular matrix. Group II underwent implantation of the tapered (tubularized) acellular matrix just beneath the seromuscular part of the bladder without connection to the bladder urothelium. Group III underwent the same procedure as group II plus reimplantation of tapered and tubularized acellular matrix (simulating an appendicovesicostomy). The distal end of the transplanted graft was connected to the bladder mucosal opening and was intubated by a 5Fr double blind ended feeding tube catheter. Biopsies were taken 3, 12, and 36months post-operatively for further histological and immunohistochemical analyses.<br />RESULTS: The results of the examinations performed prior to transplantation, revealed a decellularized structure resembling the native tissue with intact extracellular matrix, normal pits and appropriate gaps that will be suitable for further cell seeding. Histopathology examination of the biopsies after transplantations confirmed successful cell seeding with urothelial lining in groups I and III, while the inner lumen in group II showed no urothelial lining.<br />CONCLUSION: The results suggest that we can prospect to perform bladder reconstruction by the application of this method without complications of previously reported augmentation cystoplasty. In the current study we used the bladder as a natural bioreactor for autologous recellularization which may pave the road for clinical application in acellular matrix augmentation cystoplasty.","24650482","2014","3"

The significance of the microenvironment in PMP has not been well characterized.<br />METHODS: Immunoassays were used to measure cytokines and C-reactive protein (CRP). Forty-two cytokines were initially measured in 23 PMP ascites and 10 PMP peritoneal washings. On the basis of these results, matching serum and ascites samples were analyzed for ten relevant cytokines (n = 32) and CRP (n = 28). Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin-fixed tissue sections. Statistical analysis was by Wilcoxon signed rank test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and bivariate analysis.<br />RESULTS: Serum CRP was elevated in PMP and correlated to CRP level in ascites. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 (CXCL8), interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), (CXCL10), monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 (CCL2), and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1Î± (CCL3) levels were grossly elevated in ascites but did not correlate with serum levels. Cytokines normally associated with infection or tissue injury (e.g., IL-1, IL-2, interferon gamma) were not elevated. Immunohistochemistry localized IL-6 to stroma, IP-10, and MCP-1 to tumor cells and IL-8 to adipose tissue. There were complex interactions among cytokines. IL-6, in particular, had many significant correlations in ascites. Serum IL-8, MIP-1Î², and CRP were higher in PMP compared to controls.<br />CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of cytokines in PMP is distinct from infection- or injury-associated inflammation. The results support peritoneal synthesis for cytokines. CRP, IL-8, and MIP-1Î² are potential serum markers for PMP. IL-6 appears to play a central role in PMP biology. This study provides new details about PMP tumor biology and identifies possible therapeutic targets.","24046117","2014","5"

Four of them were performed by an open approach and 12 by laparoscopy (in 3 of which conversion was needed). The average length of stay was of 1.8 days, with only one complication (wound abscess). Of these 16 delayed appendectomies, 11 were not technically difficult to perform (average wait of 5.5 months) and in 5 cases the procedure was difficult due to multiple adhesions (average wait of 9.4 months).<br />CONCLUSION: Conservative management of appendicular mass is useful, with a success rate of 84% in our series. The appendectomy was less hazardous if performed 3-6 months after the onset of the symptoms.","24645240","2013","10"
"523","A plain abdominal radiograph diagnosis of appendicitis.","International journal of surgery case reports","INTRODUCTION: Despite reported poor sensitivity and specificity, plain abdominal radiographs have a role in the investigation of suspected appendicitis.<br />PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report a case of a previously healthy 47 year old man, who presented with sudden onset abdominal pain associated with a raised temperature. He gave a short history of pain around the umbilicus, which radiated to his right iliac fossa over a period of hours. On examination his abdomen was soft with rebound tenderness in the right iliac fossa. Investigations revealed white cell count 11.2Ã—109/L, CRP 4mg/L and normal haemoglobin, renal and liver function tests. An inflamed appendix was visible with thickened walls on a plain abdominal radiograph and was confirmed during laparoscopic appendectomy and subsequent histology. He made good recovery and was discharged.<br />DISCUSSION: Prominent appendiceal wall and air in the appendix has been described in the literature as a CT finding that can distinguish appendicitis from other differential diagnoses and here we present a case of diagnosis of appendicitis on a plain abdominal radiograph showing this sign which to the best of our knowledge is rarely seen on abdominal films.<br />CONCLUSION: Careful assessment of plain abdominal films in suspected appendicitis is encouraged not just for exclusion of other causes of pain but also in the possible detection of an inflamed appendix.","24240075","2013",\N

"525","Evaluation of the SO2 and NOx offset ratio method to account for secondary PM2.5 formation.","Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association (1995)","UNLABELLED: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), state and local agencies have focused their efforts in assessing secondary fine particulate matter (aerodynamic diameter < or = 2.5 microm; PM2.5) formation in prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) air dispersion modeling. The National Association of Clean Air Agencies (NACAA) developed a method to account for secondary PM2.5 formation by using sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) offset ratios. These ratios are used to estimate the secondary formation of sulfate and nitrate PM2.5. These ratios were first introduced by the EPA for nonattainment areas in the Implementation of the New Source Review (NSR) Program for Particulate Matter Less than 2.5 Micrometers (PM2.5), 73 FR 28321, to offset emission increases of direct PM2.5 emissions with reductions of PM2.5 precursors and vice versa. Some regulatory agencies such as the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) have developed area-specific offset ratios for SO2 and NOx based on Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) evaluations for air dispersion modeling analyses. The current study evaluates the effect on American Meteorological Society/Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model (AERMOD) predicted concentrations from the use of EPA and MPCA developed ratios. The study assesses the effect of these ratios on an electric generating utility (EGU), taconite mine, food processing plant, and a pulp and paper mill. The inputs used for these four scenarios are based on common stack parameters and emissions based on available data. The effect of background concentrations also evaluates these scenarios by presenting results based on uniform annual PM2.5 background values. This evaluation study helps assess the viability of the offset ratio method developed by NACAA in estimating primary and secondary PM2.5 concentrations. An alternative Tier 2 approach to combine modeled and monitored concentrations is also presented.<br />IMPLICATIONS: On January 4, 2012, the EPA committed to engage in rulemaking to evaluate updates to the Guideline on Air Quality Models (Appendix W of 40 CFR 51) and, as appropriate, incorporate new analytical techniques or models for secondary PM2.5. As a result, the National Association of Clean Air Agencies (NACAA) developed a screening method involving offset ratios to account for secondary PM2.5 formation. The use of this method is promising to evaluate total (direct and indirect) PM2.5 impacts for permitting purposes. Therefore, the evaluation of this method is important to determine its viability for widespread use.","24701685","2014","3"

Lipase has largely replaced amylase in terms of diagnostic value, although both markers are still commonly used. In this publication, we discuss the diagnostic superiority of lipase compared to amylase in acute pancreatitis. Two cases are discussed; both patients presented with elevated lipase values but due to different causes. The first patient, who had recently experienced cholecystitis, presented to the emergency room with abdominal pain and high lipase levels. The second patient, who had received a renal transplant a few years earlier, visited the gastroenterological outpatient clinic with abdominal pain and only a slightly elevated lipase level.","24330797","2013",\N

We report the first case of acute pancreatitis after posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) for spondylolisthesis that resolved with conservative treatment. A 53-year-old female patient received a PLIF from L3 to L5. The patient presented with persistent mild abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting several hours after the surgery. An abdominal CT revealed swelling of the head of the pancreas and free fluid around the pancreas. A gastroenterologist diagnosed acute pancreatitis and prescribed nafamostat mesilate, antibiotics and intravenous fluid therapy. The patient recovered gradually, and clinical symptoms disappeared. At 6Â months after the operation, she had experienced no recurrence of abdominal symptoms, and solid spinal fusion was achieved. In previous studies, acute pancreatitis was reported as a complication after spine surgery for various spine diseases such as scoliosis and lumbar disorders. The procedures performed included anterior/posterior scoliosis surgery and anterior/posterior lumbar fusion surgery. We must consider the possibility of acute pancreatitis when unusual abdominal symptoms with elevated serum amylase levels occur after spine surgery. Prompt diagnosis and supportive therapy are essential to minimize morbidity and mortality.","24318308","2014","7"

In all three, gastritis was first considered and treated due to abdominal pain, vomiting, and epigastric tenderness, but their symptoms did not improve. Then pancreatic enzymes were measured, which confirmed pancreatitis. Imaging studies showed an enlarged pancreas in one case, a normal pancreas in two cases, and a focal hypodense nonenhancing parenchyma in one case. Corticosteroids were prescribed for both active SLE and SLE-related pancreatitis. Pulse methylprednisolone was prescribed in one episode, increasing oral prednisolone in one episode, and the same dose of prednisolone continued in the other two episodes. All cases recovered without complications. SLE-related pancreatitis should be considered in SLE patients when the SLE is active and a patient develops abdominal pain and vomiting.","23673437","2013","6"
"529","Charcot arthropathy of the wrist associated with cervical spondylotic myelopathy.","Global spine journal","Backgroundâ€ƒCharcot arthropathy is a cascade of destructive changes that can effect joints of both the axial and appendicular skeleton. The pathogenesis of this condition centers around the accumulation of minor traumatic events after the loss of normal joint sensation. The most frequently cited cause of Charcot arthropathy of the upper extremity is syringomyelia, and magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine should be obtained at presentation. Case Reportâ€ƒA 72-year-old woman presented with a painless right wrist deformity. Radiographs demonstrated advanced destructive changes of the radiocarpal joint. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine revealed multilevel cervical spondylotic stenosis with cord deformation, but no evidence of syringomyelia. Neurological examination confirmed the presence of myelopathy. Literature Reviewâ€ƒThe most frequently cited cause of Charcot arthropathy of the upper extremity is syringomyelia, although pathologies such as diabetes mellitus, tabes dorsalis, leprosy, and other disorders affecting the nervous system have been reported to lead to this condition. Neuropathic arthropathy involving the wrist is a rare phenomenon with fewer than 20 published reports in modern literature. Clinical Relevanceâ€ƒCharcot arthropathy of the wrist is a rare but potentially disabling condition. The diagnosis of spondylotic myelopathy should be considered when evaluating a patient with this presentation.

"530","Dengue fever mimicking acute appendicitis: A case report.","International journal of surgery case reports","INTRODUCTION: Dengue fever is an acute viral disease, which usually presents as a mild febrile illness. Patients with severe disease present with dengue haemorrhagic fever or dengue toxic shock syndrome. Rarely, it presents with abdominal symptoms mimicking acute appendicitis. We present a case of a male patient presenting with right iliac fossa pain and suspected acute appendicitis that was later diagnosed with dengue fever following a negative appendicectomy.<br />PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 13-year old male patient presented with fever, localized right-sided abdominal pain and vomiting. Abdominal ultrasound was not helpful and appendicectomy was performed due to worsening abdominal signs and an elevated temperature. A normal appendix with enlarged mesenteric nodes was found at surgery. Complete blood count showed thrombocytopenia with leucopenia. Dengue fever was now suspected and confirmed by IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against dengue virus.<br />DISCUSSION: This unusual presentation of dengue fever mimicking acute appendicitis should be suspected during viral outbreaks and in patients with atypical symptoms and cytopenias on blood evaluation in order to prevent unnecessary surgery.<br />CONCLUSION: This case highlights the occurrence of abdominal symptoms and complications that may accompany dengue fever. Early recognition of dengue fever mimicking acute appendicitis will avoid non-therapeutic operation and the diagnosis may be aided by blood investigations indicating a leucopenia, which is uncommon in patients with suppurative acute appendicitis.","24096347","2013",\N

The patient without known allergies complained of severe abdominal pain following ingestion of salmon roe for the first time. Dyspnea, wheezing and generalized urticaria also developed. Subsequently, he had stools containing jelly-like blood with mucus. At hospital arrival, physical examination identified an abdominal mass in the right lower quadrant; imaging confirmed the diagnosis of colo-colic intussusception. This patient was successfully treated with enema and no pathological findings were identified via radiology. Laboratory results supported the presence of IgE-mediated allergy to salmon roe in the present patient.

A 75-year-old female presented to the emergency department with severe right lower quadrant pain for 3Â days. The clinical history, examination and imaging suggested a diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The patient was taken to the operating room for an open appendectomy. The intra-operative findings demonstrated a large mass at the ileocecal junction involving the appendix as well as multiple nodular masses in the ileum and cecum. The patient underwent a right hemicolectomy with ileocecal anastomosis. The pathology result revealed Ileal diverticulitis. Ileal diverticulitis is a rare form of diverticulitis. It can often mimic other processes such as acute appendicitis. Once ileal diverticulitis is diagnosed, it should be treated with the same principles as for sigmoid diverticulitis. Though rare, ileal diverticulitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient who presents with right lower quadrant pain, and a computed tomography scan that shows an inflammatory process in the right lower quadrant, in the setting of a normal appendix.","24968397","2012",\N

"536","A review of ischemic colitis: is our clinical recognition and management adequate?","Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology","Ischemic colitis is a common cause of hospital admissions; however it is frequently confused intellectually with mesenteric ischemia and often misdiagnosed as infectious diarrhea or Clostridium difficile colitis. Ischemic colitis is caused by non-occlusive insult to the small vessels supplying the colon without a clear precipitating factor. It is more common in females and in patients above 60 years of age. The classic presentation includes sudden onset of lower abdominal pain followed by the urge to defecate and bloody diarrhea. Focal right-sided ischemic colitis has more pain and a worse prognosis. Choosing the correct diagnostic studies is challenging and requires proficient knowledge of the disease. Management is usually conservative, however around 10-20% of the patients will require surgery. Acute ischemic colitis usually resolves; nevertheless some patients may develop chronic segmental colitis or a stricture. One ischemic colitis caveat is that it may be the first sign of undiagnosed cardiac disease. A firm grasp on this common yet little discussed condition is valuable to a gastrointestinal consultant and hospitalist alike.","24070152","2013","9"

At one year following surgery, the patient presented with severe pancytopenia and pain at multiple sites all over the body. Furthermore, the patient's Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score was 3 and numeric rating scale pain score was 8. The bone marrow puncture indicated bone marrow metastatic cancer, and the positron emission tomography/computed tomography (CT) indicated multiple internal organ metastases and osseous metastasis. Chemotherapy treatment posed great risks due to the patient's poor performance status and severe bone marrow suppression. Therefore, trastuzumab monotherapy was administered at a loading dose of 8 mg/kg and a maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg every three weeks. Following four doses of trastuzumab treatment, the patient's performance status significantly improved and the peripheral blood cell counts had returned to within the normal ranges. Taxol was added to the trastuzumab treatment and seven cycles were completed. No metastatic cancer cells were found in the subsequent bone marrow smear test; however, CT showed metastatic foci in the left lung.

"541","Rapidly progressive subcutaneous metastases from gallbladder cancer: insight into a rare presentation in gastrointestinal malignancies.","Journal of gastrointestinal oncology","BACKGROUND: Gallbladder cancer (GBCA) is the most common malignancy of the biliary tract. It has an aggressive biology that results in the ability to spread, seed and grow in disparate environments. It can metastasize via lymphatic, hematogenous, and peritoneal seeding. However, GBCA metastasis to distant subcutaneous sites is extremely rare.<br />CASE PRESENTATION: This case report describes the presentation of metastatic GBCA with rapidly progressive subcutaneous metastases. A 58-year-old woman presented with acute onset right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a calcified and thickened gallbladder with cholelithiasis and presumed cholecystitis. Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed a gallbladder mass. Biopsies were consistent with GBCA. The patient was referred to our cancer center for further surgical management. However, she was found to have rapidly growing subcutaneous nodules in the shoulders, chest, abdomen, and buttocks. Positron emission tomography (PET) demonstrated that these were fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid. A core needle biopsy of a chest wall lesion was consistent with metastatic GBCA. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with stage IVB GBCA and was initiated on systemic chemotherapy.<br />DISCUSSION: GBCA is known to have an incredible propensity to grow within the peritoneal cavity, as well as along needle biopsy tracts and at laparoscopic port sites. Several case reports have demonstrated that GBCA also has the potential to metastasize to distant subcutaneous sites, most often including breast metastases, while the current cases represents a more diffuse pattern of spread.<br />CONCLUSIONS: GBCA belongs to the short list of solid visceral malignancies that have the potential to develop remote subcutaneous metastases.","25083307","2014","8"

With ongoing scientific advances and applications of DNA evidence in the criminal justice system, it is increasingly important that police, lawyers, and judges recognise both the limitations of DNA evidence and the strength of the evidence in particular cases. Because most forensic sciences are formally communicated via expert reports, we analysed the readability of 68 such reports of DNA evidence from 6 of 8 Australian jurisdictions. We conducted content analyses using three categories: content and sequence, language, and format. Categories contained qualitative and quantitative items drawn from theory and past research. Report styles differed by jurisdiction and by main audience - police and the courts. Reports for police were brief and few links were made between sections in these reports. Reports for courts were less brief and used either legal or scientific styles. Common sections in reports for courts included: the scientist's specialised knowledge; laboratory accreditation information; item list; results; and notes on interpretation. Sections were often not in a logical sequence, due to the use of appendices. According to Flesch Reading Ease scores, reports for police had language that was fairly difficult, and reports for courts, difficult. Difficulty was compounded by the use of specialist terms. Reports for police and the appendices of reports for court often used very small font and single line spacing. Many reports for court contained tables that spanned several pages. Suggestions based on theory and past research are provided to assist scientists to enhance the readability of reports for non-scientists.","24530439","2014","4"

This study was carried out to assess the ability of the virus to replicate in tick cells in vitro.<br />METHODS: AHFV was inoculated into cell lines derived from the hard ticks Hyalomma anatolicum (HAE/CTVM9) and Rhipicephalus appendiculatus (RAE/CTVM1) and the soft tick Ornithodoros moubata (OME/CTVM24). Inoculated cells were directly examined every week for 4 weeks by real-time reverse transcription PCR and by IFAT using polyclonal antibodies.<br />RESULTS: AHFV RNA was detected in all three inoculated tick cell lines throughout the 4-week observation period at levels up to almost twice that of the inoculum, but none of them exhibited a cytopathic effect. AHFV antigen could be detected in all three cell lines by IFAT. Titration of tick cell culture suspension in LLC-MK2 cells yielded AHFV titres of 10(6.6) 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)/ml for OME/CTVM24 and 10(5.5) TCID50/ml for RAE/CTVM1 cells after 4 weeks of culturing; no viable virus was detected in HAE/CTVM9 cells.<br />CONCLUSION: This is the first description of propagation of AHFV in tick cells.","24097806","2013","12"

Manual reduction was attempted in all and failure was managed by emergency surgery.<br />RESULTS: The laparoscopy group had 27 patients. Four patients failed manual reduction and underwent emergency laparoscopic surgery. Three of them had small bowel strangulation which was reduced laparoscopically. The strangulated bowel was dusky in colour initially but changed to normal colour subsequently under vision. The fourth patient required appendectomy for strangulated appendix. One patient had concomitant repair of umbilical hernia and one patient had laparoscopic pyloromyotomy at the same time. One patient had testicular atrophy, one had hydrocoele and one had recurrence of hernia on the asymptomatic side. The open surgery group had 45 patients. Eleven patients had failed manual reduction requiring emergency surgery, of these two required resection and anastomosis of small intestine. One patient in this group had concomitant repair of undescended testis. There was no recurrence in this group, one had testicular atrophy and seven had metachronous hernia.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Both open herniotomy and laparoscopic repair offer safe surgery with comparable outcomes for incarcerated inguinal hernia in children. Laparoscopic approach and hernioscopy at the time of open approach appear to show the advantage of repairing the contralateral patent processus vaginalis at the same time and avoiding metachronous inguinal hernia.","24805115","2014","6"

A large, gas-distended viscus was present at the pelvic brim preventing complete palpation of the abdomen per rectum. Ultrasonographic evaluation could not be safely performed in the initial evaluation because of severe signs of abdominal pain.<br />TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: Ventral midline celiotomy was performed, and right dorsal displacement of the ascending colon was corrected. Progressive signs of abdominal pain after surgery prompted repeat ventral midline celiotomy, and small intestinal incarceration in a large, radial mesojejunal rent was detected. The incarceration was reduced, but the defect was not fully accessible for repair via the celiotomy. Repair of the mesenteric defect was not attempted, and conservative management was planned after surgery; however, signs of colic returned. A standard laparoscopic approach was attempted from both flanks in the standing patient, but the small intestine could not be adequately mobilized for full evaluation of the rent. Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) allowed identification and reduction of jejunal incarceration and repair of the mesenteric rent. Although minor ventral midline incisional complications were encountered, the horse recovered fully.<br />CLINICAL RELEVANCE: HALS techniques should be considered for repair of mesenteric rents in horses. In the horse of this report, HALS facilitated identification, evaluation, and repair of a large radial mesenteric rent that was not accessible from a ventral median celiotomy.","24094265","2013","10"

At the time of study closeout, the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were lower in the simvastatin-treated patients than in those who received placebo. The mean number of exacerbations per person-year was similar in the simvastatin and placebo groups: 1.36Â±1.61 exacerbations and 1.39Â±1.73 exacerbations, respectively (P=0.54). The median number of days to the first exacerbation was also similar: 223 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 195 to 275) and 231 days (95% CI, 193 to 303), respectively (P=0.34). The number of nonfatal serious adverse events per person-year was similar, as well: 0.63 events with simvastatin and 0.62 events with placebo. There were 30 deaths in the placebo group and 28 in the simvastatin group (P=0.89).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Simvastatin at a daily dose of 40 mg did not affect exacerbation rates or the time to a first exacerbation in patients with COPD who were at high risk for exacerbations.

Herein, we report the case of a 63-year-old woman who presented to emergency department with a 2-day history of severe diffuse abdominal pain, high-grade fever, nausea, and vomiting. Acute abdomen series was done, and upright plain chest radiograph showed free air under diaphragm. A noncontrast-enhanced computed tomography scan showed a significantly distended fluid-filled uterus measuring 10 Ã— 7.8 Ã— 10â€‰cm, in addition to a single focus of perforation involving the uterine fundus and associated with presence of free air within the nondependant area. No evidence of ascites or pelvi-abdominal lymphadenopathy was identified. A preoperative diagnosis of generalized peritonitis secondary to spontaneous perforation of uterus was established. Subsequently, patient underwent urgent exploratory laparotomy which revealed pus-filled uterus with perforated fundus. Diagnosis of generalized peritonitis secondary to spontaneous perforation of pyometra was established. Consequently, patient underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, as well as thorough drainage and irrigation of pelvi-abdominal cavity. Postoperatively, patient was admitted to intensive care unit. Histopathological examination of uterus was negative for malignancy, and surgical culture grew Streptococcus constellatus. Patient had an uneventful recovery. Moreover, a brief literature review on pyometra is presented.","24073347","2013",\N

"549","CLIMBER: Climatic niche characteristics of the butterflies in Europe.","ZooKeys","Detailed information on species' ecological niche characteristics that can be related to declines and extinctions is indispensable for a better understanding of the relationship between the occurrence and performance of wild species and their environment and, moreover, for an improved assessment of the impacts of global change. Knowledge on species characteristics such as habitat requirements is already available in the ecological literature for butterflies, but information about their climatic requirements is still lacking. Here we present a unique dataset on the climatic niche characteristics of 397 European butterflies representing 91% of the European species (see Appendix). These characteristics were obtained by combining detailed information on butterfly distributions in Europe (which also led to the 'Distribution Atlas of Butterflies in Europe') and the corresponding climatic conditions. The presented dataset comprises information for the position and breadth of the following climatic niche characteristics: mean annual temperature, range in annual temperature, growing degree days, annual precipitation sum, range in annual precipitation and soil water content. The climatic niche position is indicated by the median and mean value for each climate variable across a species' range, accompanied by the 95% confidence interval for the mean and the number of grid cells used for calculations. Climatic niche breadth is indicated by the standard deviation and the minimum and maximum values for each climatic variable across a species' range. Database compilation was based on high quality standards and the data are ready to use for a broad range of applications. It is already evident that the information provided in this dataset is of great relevance for basic and applied ecology. Based on the species temperature index (STI, i.e. the mean temperature value per species), the community temperature index (CTI, i.e. the average STI value across the species in a community) was recently adopted as an indicator of climate change impact on biodiversity by the pan-European framework supporting the Convention on Biological Diversity (Streamlining European Biodiversity Indicators 2010) and has already been used in several scientific publications. The application potential of this database ranges from theoretical aspects such as assessments of past niche evolution or analyses of trait interdependencies to the very applied aspects of measuring, monitoring and projecting historical, ongoing and potential future responses to climate change using butterflies as an indicator.","24478578","2014",\N
"550","Acute appendicitis: position paper, WSES, 2013.","World journal of emergency surgery : WJES","Appendectomy is one of the most frequently performed operative procedures in general surgery departments of every size and category. Laparoscopic Appendectomy - LA - as compared to Open Appendectomy - OA - was very controversial at first but has found increasing acceptance all over the World, although the percentage of its acceptance is different in the various single National setting. Various meta-analyses and Cochrane reviews have compared LA with OA and different technical details. Furthermore, new surgical methods have recently emerged, namely, the single-port/incision laparoscopic appendectomy and NOTES technique. Their distribution among the hospitals, however, is unclear. Using laparoscopic mini-instruments with trocars of 2-3.5Â mm diameter is proposed as a reliable alternative due to less postoperative pain and improved aesthetics. How to proceed in case of an inconspicuous appendix during a procedure planned as an appendectomy remains controversial despite existing study results. But the main question still is: operate or not operate an acute appendicitis, in the meaning of an attempt of a conservative antibiotic therapy. Therefore, we have done a literature survey on the performance of appendectomies and their technical details as well as the management of the intraoperative finding of an inconspicuous appendix in order to write down - under the light of the latest evidence - a position paper.","24708651","2014",\N
"551","Risk factors for conversion from laparoscopic to open surgery: analysis of 2138 converted operations in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program.","The American surgeon","Minimal access procedures have influenced surgical practice and patient expectations. Risk of laparoscopic conversion to open surgery is frequently cited but vaguely quantified. The present study examines three common procedures to identify risk factors for laparoscopic conversion to open (LCO) events. Cross-sectional analysis using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP; 2005 to 2009) identified cases with laparoscopic procedure codes for appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and bariatric procedures. The primary outcome was conversion of a laparoscopic procedure to its open equivalent. Summary statistics for laparoscopic and LCO groups were compared and logistic regression analysis was used to estimate patient and operative risk factors for conversion. Of 176,014 selected laparoscopic operations, 2,138 (1.2%) were converted. Most patients were female (68%) and white (71.2%); mean age was 45.1 years. LCO cholecystectomy was significantly more likely (n = 1526 [1.9%]) and LCO bariatric procedures were less likely (n = 121 [0.3%]); appendectomy was intermediate (n = 491 [1.0%], P < 0.001). Patient factors associated with LCO included male sex (P < 0.001), age 30 years or older (P < 0.025), American Society of Anesthesiologists Class 2 to 4 (P < 0.001), obesity (P < 0.01), history of bleeding disorder (P = 0.036), or preoperative systemic inflammatory response syndrome or sepsis (P < 0.001). LCO was associated with greater incidence of postoperative complications, including death, organ space surgical site infection, sepsis, wound dehiscence, and return to the operating room (P < 0.001). Overall LCO incidence is low in hospitals participating in ACS-NSQIP. Conversion risk factors include patient age, sex, obesity, and preoperative comorbidity as well as the procedure performed. This information should be valuable to clinicians in discussing conversion risk with patients.","24069991","2013","9"

The aim of this systematic review was to gather information concerning its prevalence, clinical image, diagnosis, and treatment.<br />DATA SOURCES: The MEDLINE database was thoroughly searched using the keyword \"Amyand's hernia.\" Additional articles were gathered and evaluated.<br />CONCLUSIONS: The true prevalence of Amyand's hernia seems lower than classically described. Its usual clinical image is identical to that of an incarcerated hernia, and thus it is almost impossible to diagnose preoperatively, although ultrasound and computed tomography can help. Treatment includes hernioplasty with or without appendectomy and/or mesh repair depending on the vermiform appendix's inflammation status, the patient's general condition, and other factors. Amyand's hernia generally has a good prognosis, although serious complications have been described. Surgeons should be prepared if they encounter Amyand's hernia because appropriate treatment ensures hernia repair without complications and with avoidance of recurrence.","24280148","2014","6"

Overall, 48 patients (31 men, age 65.9 Â± 11.5) had type A and type B IMH involving the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta (DeBakey I and III).<br />RESULTS: Among the 48 patients, 26 (54 %; 17 men, aged 64.3 Â± 11.4 years) had 71 aortic branch artery pseudoaneurysms. Overall, during a mean follow-up of 22.1 Â± 9.5 months (range 12-42 months), 31 (44 %) pseudoaneurysms disappeared; 22 (31 %) decreased in size; two (3 %) remained stable; and 16 (22 %) increased in size. Among the 16 pseudoaneurysms with increasing size, five of these (three intercostal arteries, one combined intercostobronchial/intercostal arteries, one renal artery), present in five symptomatic patients, had a significant increase in size (thickness >10 mm; width and length >20 mm). These five patients underwent endovascular embolization with coils and/or Amplatzer Vascular Plug. In all patients, complete thrombosis and exclusion of aortic pseudoaneurysm and relief of back pain were achieved.<br />CONCLUSION: Aortic branch artery pseudoaneurysms associated with type A and type B IMH involving the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta (DeBakey I and III) may be considered relatively benign lesions. However, a small number may grow in size or extend longitudinally with clinical symptoms during follow-up, and in these cases, endovascular embolization can be an effective and safe procedure.","23161363","2013","4"
"555","A randomized trial of epidural glucocorticoid injections for spinal stenosis.","The New England journal of medicine","BACKGROUND: Epidural glucocorticoid injections are widely used to treat symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis, a common cause of pain and disability in older adults. However, rigorous data are lacking regarding the effectiveness and safety of these injections.<br />METHODS: In a double-blind, multisite trial, we randomly assigned 400 patients who had lumbar central spinal stenosis and moderate-to-severe leg pain and disability to receive epidural injections of glucocorticoids plus lidocaine or lidocaine alone. The patients received one or two injections before the primary outcome evaluation, performed 6 weeks after randomization and the first injection. The primary outcomes were the score on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ, in which scores range from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating greater physical disability) and the rating of the intensity of leg pain (on a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating \"pain as bad as you can imagine\").<br />RESULTS: At 6 weeks, there were no significant between-group differences in the RMDQ score (adjusted difference in the average treatment effect between the glucocorticoid-lidocaine group and the lidocaine-alone group, -1.0 points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.1 to 0.1; P=0.07) or the intensity of leg pain (adjusted difference in the average treatment effect, -0.2 points; 95% CI, -0.8 to 0.4; P=0.48). A prespecified secondary subgroup analysis with stratification according to type of injection (interlaminar vs. transforaminal) likewise showed no significant differences at 6 weeks.<br />CONCLUSIONS: In the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis, epidural injection of glucocorticoids plus lidocaine offered minimal or no short-term benefit as compared with epidural injection of lidocaine alone.

Tumor resection en bloc with major vascular structures and/or thrombectomy at post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection was done in 240 patients, of whom 89 had a total of 98 intraluminal thrombi involving major vasculature.<br />RESULTS: The site of the 98 thrombi was the inferior vena cava (72), aorta (1) and renal vein (20). Management of the 72 vena caval thrombi included cavectomy (36), partial cavectomy (9) and thrombectomy (27). For the 20 renal vein thrombi management included nephrectomy (18) and thrombectomy (2). The single aortic thrombus was managed by aortic resection and replacement. Pathological evaluation revealed bland thrombi in 31 cases, necrosis in 23, teratoma in 28, active germ cell cancer in 12 and sarcoma in 4. In 40 patients a total of 71 additional procedures were required, including nephrectomy in 32, liver resection in 6, bowel resection in 7, thoracotomy in 6, vertebral resection in 3, orchiectomy in 11, and duodenal repair, ureteroureterotomy, stent removal, cholecystectomy, appendectomy and paraspinal tumor removal in 1 each.

Average estimated blood loss was 1,165 ml (range 200 to 7,000) and average hospital stay was 9.3 days (range 2 to 70).<br />CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of intraluminal thrombus at post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection is 5.8%. Cancer pathology was observed in 44.9% of cases. Surgeons who perform post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection should be well versed in vascular techniques with respect to the major vasculature.","23517745","2013","9"

Two radiologists who were blinded to clinical data interpreted all studies as (1) demonstrating an abnormal ovary or not, and (2) suggestive of torsion or not. Sensitivity, specificity and interobserver variation were calculated for each imaging modality.<br />RESULTS: Pelvic US was interpreted as demonstrating an abnormal ovary in 90.0% of ovarian torsion cases by reader 1, and in 100.0% by reader 2, whereas CT was interpreted as revealing an abnormal ovary in 100.0% of torsion cases by both readers. Pelvic US for ovarian torsion was 80.0% sensitive (95% CI, 58.4-91.9%) and 95.0% specific (95% CI, 76.4-99.1%) for reader 1, while 80.0% sensitive (95% CI, 58.4-91.9%) and 85.0% specific (95% CI, 64.0-95.0%) for reader 2. Interobserver agreement for pelvic US was fair (Kappa=0.60). Abdominopelvic CT for ovarian torsion was 100.0% sensitive (95% CI, 83.9-100.0%) and 85.0% specific (95% CI, 64.0-94.5%) for reader 1, while 90.0% sensitive (95% CI, 69.9-97.2%) and 90.0% specific (95% CI, 69.9-97.2%) for reader 2. Interobserver agreement was excellent (Kappa=0.85).<br />CONCLUSION: The diagnostic performance of CT is not shown to be significantly different from that of US in identifying ovarian torsion in this study. These results suggest that when CT demonstrates findings of ovarian torsion, the performance of another imaging exam (i.e. US) that delays therapy is unlikely to improve preoperative diagnostic yield.","24480106","2014","4"

Seven hundred twenty-two men (young [aged 20-39 years], n = 211; middle-aged [aged 40-59 years], n = 347; and old [aged 6095 years], n = 164) and 785 women (young, n = 207; middle-aged, n = 341; and old, n = 237) were recruited for this cross-sectional study. Muscle thickness (MTH) and subcutaneous fat thickness (FTH) were measured by ultrasound at 8 sites on the anterior and posterior aspects of the body. MTH was expressed in terms relative to limb length (MTH/L) or height (MTH/Ht). Percent body fat was estimated from FTH, and fat-free mass (FFM) was calculated. In men, a graded decrease in FFM was found in all age groups. In women, FFM was similar in the young and middle-aged groups, but was lower in the oldest group. Age was significantly and inversely correlated with FFM in men (r = - 0.358, p < 0.01), but not in women (r = -0.08). On the other hand, age was strongly and inversely correlated with quadriceps MTH/L (men, r = -0.529; women, r = -0.489; both p < 0.001) and abdomen MTH/Ht (men, r = -0.464; women, r = -0.446; both p < 0.001) in both men and women, while there were only weak correlations between age and other lower limb and trunk sites. Our results indicated that sarcopenia is observed as a site-specific loss of skeletal muscle mass, especially for the quadriceps and abdominal muscles, in Japanese men and women aged 20 to 95 years.

The Massachusetts Coalition for the Prevention of Medical Errors has endorsed the creation of systems to ensure that results can be received and acknowledged.<br />METHODS: In 2008 a task force was convened that represented clinicians, laboratories, radiology, patient safety, risk management, and information systems in a large health care network with the goals of providing recommendations and a road map for improvement in the management of CSTR and of implementing this improvement plan during the sub-force sequent five years. In drafting its charter, the task broadened the scope from \"critical\" results to \"clinically significant\" ones; clinically significant was defined as any result that requires further clinical action to avoid morbidity or mortality, regardless of the urgency of that action.<br />RESULTS: The task force recommended four key areas for improvement--(1) standardization of policies and definitions, (2) robust identification of the patient's care team, (3) enhanced results management/tracking systems, and (4) centralized quality reporting and metrics. The task force faced many challenges in implementing these recommendations, including disagreements on definitions of CSTR and on who should have responsibility for CSTR, changes to established work flows, limitations of resources and of existing information systems, and definition of metrics.<br />CONCLUSIONS: This large-scale effort to improve the communication and follow-up of CSTR in a health care network continues with ongoing work to address implementation challenges, refine policies, prepare for a new clinical information system platform, and identify new ways to measure the extent of this important safety problem.","24294680","2013","11"

As these lesions tend to respond poorly to radio- and chemotherapy, currently the standard surgical paradigm for the treatment of spinal GCTs involves en bloc surgical resection. Denosumab is a newly developed monoclonal antibody designed to inhibit the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) which has already been demonstrated to induce marked radiographic responses on GCTs of the appendicular skeleton. Nevertheless, the role of denosumab in the treatment algorithm of GCTs of the spine has not yet been defined.<br />PURPOSE: To describe the first case of sustained long-term complete clinical and radiographic regression of a GCT of the spine after treatment with the new RANKL antibody denosumab.<br />STUDY DESIGN: Case report and literature review.<br />METHODS: The authors describe the case of 22-year-old female patient, harboring a GCT involving the C2 vertebral body and odontoid process, who was treated in monotherapy with denosumab, resulting in complete long-term clinical and radiographic tumor remission.<br />RESULTS: There were no major side effects associated with the long-term pharmacological treatment with denosumab. From the clinical standpoint, the patient demonstrated complete remission of the disease while under treatment. The 16-month radiographic follow-up demonstrated complete disappearance of the osteolytic process and intense new cortical bone formation with restoration of the bone integrity of the C2 vertebral body.<br />CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of sustained long-term complete clinical and radiographic regression of a GCT of the spine after treatment with the new RANKL antibody denosumab. Although future long-term follow-up studies are still necessary to establish important key points regarding the best therapeutic protocol with such a new drug (such as the optimal time frame to keep the patient under treatment), denosumab promises to bring major changes to the current therapeutic paradigm for GCTs of the spine, which, up to now, has strongly relied on en bloc surgical resection.","24534393","2014","7"

A 56-year-old Caucasian male was admitted to our surgical department with a chief complaint of a painful mass in his right lower abdomen for almost 2 years. The physical examination revealed a palpable painful mass. Computed tomography demonstrated an irregular, cystic tumor in his right lower abdomen. There was no obvious capsule or internal septations. No enhancement after intravenous administration of contrast was noted. An exploratory laparotomy was performed, and a multicystic tumor and adherent to the caecum was noted. The walls of the cysts were thin and smooth, filled with clear fluid, and very friable. An en bloc resection of the tumor, including appendix and caecum, was performed. Histological examination revealed multiple cysts lined with flattened simple epithelial cells, and the capsule walls of the cysts were composed of fibrous tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis documented positive expression of mesothelial cells and calretinin. The final diagnosis was BMPM. The patient was well at 6-mo follow-up. BMPM is exceedingly rare lesion.

Cell numbers were low in winter and peaked in summer, showing a marked seasonality that positively correlated with day length and light at the surface. Bacteriochlorophyll a concentration, their light-harvesting pigment, was only detected between April and October, and pigment cell quota showed large variations during this period. Pyrosequencing analysis of the pufM gene revealed that the most abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were affiliated to phylogroup K (Gammaproteobacteria) and uncultured phylogroup C, although they were outnumbered by alphaproteobacterial OTUs in spring. Overall, richness was higher in winter than in summer, showing an opposite trend to abundance and day length. Clustering of samples by multivariate analyses showed a clear seasonality that suggests a succession of different AAP subpopulations over time. Temperature, chlorophyll a and day length were the environmental drivers that best explained the distribution of AAP assemblages. These results indicate that AAP bacteria are highly dynamic and undergo seasonal variations in diversity and abundance mostly dictated by environmental conditions as exemplified by light availability.","24131493","2014","9"

A chest CT scan located the thrombus in the stump (a blind-ended vessel) of the left superior pulmonary vein. Therefore, thromboembolic RI caused by pulmonary vein thrombosis was suspected. Anticoagulation therapy was initiated with heparin and warfarin to treat RI and to prevent further embolic episodes. Two months later, pulmonary vein thrombosis had resolved without the appearance of additional peripheral infarction. This case emphasizes the need to consider thrombus in the stump of the pulmonary vein as a cause of RI.","24987406","2014","5"
"568","Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the appendix in which contrast-enhanced ultrasonography was useful for assessing blood flow in a focal nodular lesion in the tumor cavity: A case report.","Experimental and therapeutic medicine","A 63-year-old woman was admitted to hospital with pain in the right lower quadrant. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a 60-mm cystic mass at a site corresponding to the appendix. The mass wall on the appendicular ostium was thickened and enhanced by contrast, while calcification was observed in the mass wall on the appendicular tip. No projection was observed in the mass cavity. On abdominal ultrasonography (US), the mass wall on the appendicular ostium was thickened and projections were observed at two sites in the mass cavity. On contrast-enhanced US (CEUS), only one of these projections was enhanced. Based on the thickened and contrast-enhanced wall of the mass on the appendicular ostium on CT and US, as well as the contrast enhancement of a projection on US, the mass was diagnosed as mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the appendix. Ileocecal resection was subsequently performed on day 10. A detailed examination of the surgical specimen revealed carcinoma cells in the mass wall on the appendicular ostium. The contrast-enhanced projection was identified as granulation tissue that had grown to come into contact with the tumor, while the non-contrast-enhanced projection was identified as solidified mucus. US enabled successful visualization of projections in the mass cavity that were not visible on abdominal CT. CEUS also proved useful for assessing blood flow in these projections.","23935709","2013","7"

After 2 months, the patient presented with a worsening of clinical symptoms complaining of severe back pain radiating to the lower extremities associated with a progressive paraparesis, urinary incontinence, and abdominal pain. Referred to our department, at the time of admission the patient was bedridden because of the impossibility of maintaining a standing position. The patient underwent a T11-T12 laminectomy with fenestration of the cyst.<br />RESULTS: She experienced an immediate relief of pain symptoms, and by the seventh postoperative day she was able to stand without help and walk a few meters with assistance. By the sixth postoperative month, the patient had significantly improved, having gained the ability to walk alone without assistance with complete resolution of the bladder dysfunctions, with no cyst recurrence after approximately 2 years of follow-up.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Intramedullary arachnoid cysts should be considered in the differential diagnosis for intramedullary cystic lesions. A particular consideration deserves their occurrence in asymptomatic patients, who should be adequately informed on the possible natural evolution: when symptomatic, surgical therapy should be promptly offered, considering that a postoperative complete recovery is usually observed, regardless of the surgical technique.","24262859","2014","6"
"571","On the suitability of Thiel cadavers for natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES): surgical training, feasibility studies, and anatomical education.","Surgical endoscopy","BACKGROUND: Surgical training in virtual, animal and cadaver models is essential for minimally invasive surgery. Thiel cadavers are suitable for laparoscopy, but there are few data about the use of embalmed (Tutsch method) and slightly embalmed (Thiel method) cadavers in procedures of Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES), which are usually developed and learned on swine models and fresh frozen cadavers. The aim of this study was thus to assess the use of these cadavers for NOTES approaches.<br />METHODS: The following surgical procedures were evaluated: transanal total mesorectal excision (four cadavers: one Tutsch, two Thiel, one fresh frozen), transanal ileorectal bypass (five cadavers: one Tutsch, three Thiel, one fresh frozen), and transvaginal appendectomy (two Tutsch cadaver).<br />RESULTS: The Thiel method ensured tissue flexibility and consistency suitable for performing the above surgical procedures with good results and without complications, with only a small increase in rigidity with respect to fresh specimens. Cadavers embalmed with higher formalin concentrations (Tutsch method) were more difficult to use, due to high tissue rigidity and resistance of the abdominal wall to pneumoperitoneum, although NOTES accesses were possible.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Thiel cadavers are suitable for transanal/transrectal and transvaginal NOTES approaches, for training surgical residents/specialists and also for surgical research. In minimally invasive surgery (and particularly in NOTES), integration between cadaver (fresh frozen and/or Thiel) and animal models would represent the gold standard, allowing guaranteed knowledge of and respect for human surgical anatomy and correct management of surgery on living subjects. NOTES approaches to human cadavers may also be proposed for the anatomical education of medical students.","25060684","2014","7"
"572","Identification of preoperative risk factors associated with the conversion of laparoscopic to open appendectomies.","International surgery","Our goals were to (1) identify risk factors associated with conversion from laparoscopic to open appendectomies and (2) establish criteria that predict the possibility of conversion to an open technique. We did a retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomies during a 5-year period (2004-2008). Preoperative risk factors, intraoperative findings, and postoperative complications were compared. We found that of 763 patients who had undergone laparoscopic appendectomy, 44 patients were converted to open technique (conversion rate of 5.8%). For these 44 patients, the male to female ratio was 2 to 1, and the men were older (45 versus 37 years of age, P < 0.001). Conversion rates decreased with time (8.7% in 2004 versus 3.5% in 2008). Past surgical history was insignificant. However, a duration of symptoms of >5 days as well as a white blood cell count >20,000 were found to have a direct correlation. Incidence of postoperative complications did not increase in converted patients. The conversion rate is highest in male patients above 45 years of age, with over 5 days' duration of symptoms, leukocytosis >20,000, and ruptured appendicitis on computed tomography scan. The presence of 3 to 4 of these risk factors should lower the threshold for consideration of conversion to open appendectomy.","24229020",\N,\N
"573","Single port laparoscopic appendectomy in children using glove port and conventional rigid instruments.","Annals of surgical treatment and research","PURPOSE: To further improve the advantages of minimally invasive surgery, single port laparoscopic techniques continue to be developed. We report our initial experience with single port laparoscopic appendectomy (SPLA) in children and compare its outcomes to those of conventional laparoscopic appendectomy (CLA).<br />METHODS: Clinical data were prospectively collected for SPLA cases performed at Chung-Ang University Hospital by a single surgeon between March 2011 and December 2011, including operative time, perioperative complications, conversion rate, and length of hospital stay. Each case of SPLA was performed using conventional laparoscopic instruments through Glove port placed into the single umbilical incision. To compare outcomes, a retrospective review was performed for those patients who underwent CLA between March 2010 and December 2010.<br />RESULTS: Thirty-one patients underwent SPLA and 114 patients underwent CLA. Mean age (10.5 years vs. 11.1 years, P = 0.43), weight (48.2 kg vs. 42.9 kg, P = 0.27), and operation time (41.8 minutes vs. 37.9 minutes, P = 0.190) were comparable between both groups. Mean hospital stay was longer for CLA group (2.6 days vs. 3.7 days, P = 0.013). There was no conversion to conventional laparoscopic surgery in SPLA group. In CLA group, there were nine complications (7.9%) with 3 cases of postoperative ileuses and 6 cases wound problems. There was one complication (3.2%) of umbilical surgical site infection in SPLA group (P = 0.325).<br />CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrated that SPLA using conventional laparoscopic instruments is technically feasible and safe in children. SPLA using conventional laparoscopic instruments might be popularized by eliminating the need for specially designed instruments.","24761405","2014","1"

American journal of roentgenology","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to evaluate the usefulness of the tensile gallbladder fundus sign on CT in diagnosing early acute cholecystitis.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: The tensile gallbladder fundus sign on CT is defined as the absence of gallbladder fundus flattening by the anterior abdominal wall due to increased gallbladder pressures. Between October 2010 and March 2012, 222 patients with confirmed diagnoses of acute cholecystitis by surgery or follow-up imaging studies underwent CT scans in the emergency department because of right upper quadrant pain. Two radiologists retrospectively reviewed all CT images to determine the presence of the tensile gallbladder fundus sign and other CT findings previously reported to be suggestive of acute cholecystitis. Diagnostic performances were calculated and analyzed using pairwise comparisons of receiver operating characteristic curves. The kappa statistic was calculated to evaluate the interobserver agreement.<br />RESULTS: Using the diagnostic criteria in which acute cholecystitis is defined as the presence of three or more classic CT findings, the addition of the tensile gallbladder fundus sign increased the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az) value from 0.693 to 0.739 (p = 0.003). In the subgroup of 91 patients with no other CT features suggestive of acute cholecystitis, the sensitivity, specificity, and Az value of the tensile gallbladder fundus sign for acute cholecystitis were 74.1%, 96.9%, and 0.855, respectively. Interobserver agreement was good with the tensile gallbladder fundus sign (Îº = 0.721).<br />CONCLUSION: The tensile gallbladder fundus sign may be useful for diagnosing acute cholecystitis, especially in the early stage when other CT findings are absent.","23883214","2013","8"

"579","Interhospital transfer and adverse outcomes after general surgery: implications for pay for performance.","Journal of the American College of Surgeons","BACKGROUND: Interhospital transfer is frequent, and transferred patients can have worse outcomes than direct admissions. We sought to define the incidence of interhospital transfer in general surgery and evaluate its association with surgical outcomes.<br />STUDY DESIGN: The 2011 American College of Surgeons NSQIP database was used. Transferred patients were compared with urgent, inpatient direct admissions in a series of increasingly complex risk-adjustment models, including multiple regression using modified Poisson and negative binomial models, as well as propensity scores. Primary outcomes were overall complications, mortality, length of stay, and readmission.<br />RESULTS: Overall, 7% of inpatient general surgery cases were transferred in. Among urgent cases, there were 6,197 transferred patients and 47,267 direct admissions. The most common procedures for direct admissions were appendectomy and cholecystectomy, and transfers had a more complex and broader range of procedures. On unadjusted analysis, transferred patients had a much higher risk for complications (risk ratio [RR] = 1.48; 95% CI, 1.45-1.52) and mortality (RR = 2.70; 95% CI, 2.48-2.94), as well as a longer length of stay (1.74 times longer; 95% CI, 1.69-1.78) and higher risk of readmission (RR = 1.31; 95% CI, 1.20-1.44). In the most sophisticated model, the propensity score match, the difference in outcomes for transferred patients was only modestly higher or equivalent (complications: RR = 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00-1.07; mortality: RR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.88-1.09; length of stay: 1.08 times longer; 95% CI, 1.04-1.11; readmission: RR = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.88-1.08).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Interhospital transfer is frequent in surgery. Worse outcomes seen in transferred patients are largely due to confounding by patient characteristics rather than any true harm from transfer. Pay-for-performance schemes should adjust for transfer status to avoid unfairly penalizing hospitals that frequently accept transfers.","24468232","2014","3"

Secondary objectives focused on assessing other predictors of ED revisits.<br />METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children <18 years old, diagnosed as having constipation (International Classification of Diseases-10 codes F98.1 nonorganic encopresis, K59.0 constipation) in a pediatric ED in Toronto, Canada, between November 2008 and October 2010.<br />RESULTS: A total of 3592 visits were included; 6% (nâ€Š=â€Š225) were associated with a revisit. Children with revisits more frequently had vomiting (28% vs 17%, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.001), more pain (5.7â€ŠÂ±â€Š3.6 vs 4.6-3.6 of 10, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.01), and underwent more blood tests (19% 05, 11%, 95% confidence interval [CI] of the difference 3%-14%] and diagnostic imaging (62% vs 47%, 95% CI of the difference 9%-22%).

The aim of this study is to elucidate the etiology, clinical features, and therapeutic options on what several authors call \"abdominal intercostal hernia\" (AIH).<br />METHODS: A typical case of AIH of the 9th left intercostal space in a 48-year-old man is presented. A literature search was conducted on the Medline and Scopus databases. Only acquired AIHs (AAIHs) were considered, while lung, transdiaphragmatic, and congenital intercostal hernias were excluded.<br />RESULTS: Eighteen studies met selection criteria and a total of 20 patients were useful for analysis. Etiology was related mainly to traumatism (65Â %) or to previous surgery (20Â %). The intercostal defects were mostly located under the 9th rib without significant differences as to side. The main symptom was chest swelling (85Â %), often associated with discomfort or pain (76Â %). Acute complications such as incarceration and strangulation occurred in three patients. CT was the most employed diagnostic tool (80Â %). Early diagnosis was made in 25Â % of cases. Seventeen patients underwent hernia repair with either open (73Â %) or laparoscopic approach (28Â %), and various techniques with and without prosthesis were described. Recurrence occurred in 28.6Â % of patients, during a mean follow-up of 8.6Â months.<br />CONCLUSIONS: AAIH should be always suspected when chest swelling occurs after a minor or major trauma, and CT must be promptly performed to rule out diaphragmatic or abdominal viscera injury. This condition requires surgery to prevent serious complications, the first-choice technique should be mesh tension-free repair.","24623405","2014","10"

Sarcopenia was assessed by appendicular skeletal muscle mass divided by weight.<br />RESULTS: In the normal waist circumference category, the risk of metabolic syndrome was nearly 3.5-fold higher in sarcopenic men (OR, 3.39; 95% CI, 1.67-6.90) than in those without sarcopenia. For the high waist circumference category, the risk of metabolic syndrome was 2.5-fold higher in sarcopenic women (OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.66-3.40) than in those without sarcopenia. The corresponding risk was also higher in sarcopenic men (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.11-2.94) than in those without sarcopenia. With the exception in men with high waist circumference category, adjustments for other potential confounders did not substantially affect the results. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass divided by weight as a continuous variable was also associated with metabolic syndrome in men (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.35-0.44) and women (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.48-0.60).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia is associated with metabolic syndrome in men with normal waist circumference and women with high waist circumference. Our results emphasize that sarcopenia may contribute additionally to the risk of metabolic abnormalities beyond what is predicted by the abdominal obesity category.","24074549","2014","8"
"584","Spinal stenosis frequent in children with multiple hereditary exostoses.","Journal of children's orthopaedics","PURPOSE: Children with multiple hereditary exostoses (MHE) have numerous osteochondromas, with the most prominent lesions typically over the appendicular skeleton. A recent report noted a high rate of intracanal lesions in this patient population and recommended preventative spinal screening with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT). We sought to evaluate the prevalence of spinal stenosis from intracanal osteochondromas at our pediatric orthopedic center in order to evaluate if routine screening is warranted.<br />METHODS: All pediatric patients treated for MHE were retrospectively identified. Records were reviewed to determine demographics, previous orthopedic surgery, and indication and results of axial spine imaging (CT or MRI). Imaging studies were reviewed to evaluate the presence of intracanal and compressive spinal lesions.<br />RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2011, axial imaging was performed in nine patients with MHE due to concerns of pain, weakness, and/or dizziness. These patients had moderate disease involvement, with a mean of 4.9 previous orthopedic surgeries to address skeletal osteochondromas. Two patients with MHE had cervical spinal stenosis secondary to intracanal osteochondromas. Both children successfully underwent spinal decompression. Thus, of our MHE population undergoing axial imaging, 22Â % were noted to have intracanal lesions.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Our experience reveals a >20Â % rate of compressive intracanal osteochondromas in MHE patients undergoing spinal imaging. These two patients represent 5Â % of the MHE patients treated at our center. These lesions may be slow growing, and significant consequences can occur if not identified promptly. Thus, we confer that routine axial screening of the spinal canal may be warranted in these children.","24432077","2013","6"

Interpretation of such information on CT is usually based on visual assessment by medical professionals and still remains a challenge in a variety of settings of the medical emergency care. This paper reports a pilot study in the implementation of image processing methods for automated detection of intestinal wall abnormalities and bowel ischemia, which can be of a potential application for CT-based detection of the intestinal disease.<br />METHODS: CT scans of 3 patients of ischemia, one benign and one control subjects were used in this study. Statistical and geometrical features of the CT scans were extracted for pattern classification using two distance measures and the k-nearest neighbor algorithm. The automated detection of intestinal abnormalities and ischemia was carried out using labeled data from the training process with various proportions of training and testing samples to validate the results.<br />RESULTS: Detection rates of intestinal ischemia and abnormalities are promising in terms of sensitivity and specificity, where the sensitivity is higher than the specificity in all test cases. The overall classification accuracy between the diseased and control subjects can be as high as 100% when all CT scans were included for measuring the difference between a cohort of three patients of ischemia and a single control subject.<br />CONCLUSION: The proposed approach can be utilized as a computer-aided tool for decision making in the emergency department, where the availability of expert knowledge of the radiologist and surgeon about this complex bowel disease is limited.","25077973","2014",\N

Risk of malignancy index (RMI) was calculated for each patient with a published formula (RMI=Ultrasonic score X menopausal status X Ca-125 (IU/ml) level). RMI >200 was accepted as positive for malignancy and the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of RMI in detecting malignant cases were calculated.<br />RESULTS: One hundred consecutive patients of whom 80 (80%) had benign ovarian cyst, 4 (4%) had borderline lesion and 16 (16%) had invasive ovarian cancer were included in the study. Forty-five percent (9/20) of malignant cases were epithelial ovarian cancer, 20% (4/20) were borderline ovarian tumor, 30% (6/20) were non-epithelial ovarian tumor and 5% (1/20) was a metastasis from the appendix. All the cases with epithelial ovarian cancer had positive RMI but only 1 of 4 borderline lesions, 2 of 6 non-epithelial ovarian cancers had positive RMI. The sensitivity of RMI was 60%, specificity was 88.8%, PPV was 57.1% and NPV was 89.9% for all cases. When the cancer cases other than epithelial ovarian cancers were excluded, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of RMI was 76.92%, 88.75%, 52.63% and 95.95% respectively.<br />CONCLUSIONS: RMI is not adequate in detecting malignant cases in a population with high non-epithelial ovarian cancer and borderline ovarian tumor prevalence.","24591890","2010",\N
"588","Evaluation of nausea and vomiting: a case-based approach.","American family physician","In the absence of acute abdominal pain, significant headache, or recent initiation of certain medications, acute nausea and vomiting is usually the result of self-limited gastrointestinal infections. Nausea and vomiting is also a common adverse effect of radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgical anesthesia. Other potential diagnoses include endocrine conditions (including pregnancy), central nervous system disorders, psychiatric causes, toxin exposure, metabolic abnormalities, and obstructive or functional gastrointestinal causes. The likely cause of acute nausea and vomiting can usually be determined by history and physical examination. Alarm signs such as dehydration, acidosis caused by an underlying metabolic disorder, or an acute abdomen warrant additional evaluation. Based on the suspected diagnosis, basic laboratory testing may include urinalysis, urine pregnancy testing, complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, amylase and lipase levels, thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and stool studies with cultures. Imaging studies include abdominal radiography, ultrasonography, and computed tomography. Computed tomography of the head should be performed if an acute intracranial process is suspected. Chronic nausea and vomiting is defined by symptoms that persist for at least one month. Patients with risk factors for gastric malignancies or alarm symptoms should be evaluated with esophagogastroduodenoscopy. If gastroparesis is suspected, a gastric emptying study is recommended. In addition to functional causes, it is also important to consider psychiatric causes when evaluating patients with chronic nausea and vomiting.","24134044","2013","9"

The aims of this study were to compare body composition and cardio-metabolic risk factors for CVD and T2D between active and inactive groups (part 1, cross-sectional analysis) and, to determine whether PA level predicts changes in body composition and cardio-metabolic risk factors for CVD and T2D at follow-up after 5.5-years (part 2, longitudinal analysis).<br />METHODS: Part 1 included a sample of 240 apparently healthy black SA women (26â€‰Â±â€‰7 years) who underwent the following measurements at baseline: PA (Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ)), body composition and regional fat distribution (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and computerised tomography), blood pressure, fasting glucose, insulin and lipid concentrations. For part 2, a sub-sample of women (nâ€‰=â€‰57) underwent the same measurements after a 5.5-year period.<br />RESULTS: At baseline, 61% of women were classified as meeting the guidelines for moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) according to GPAQ. Women who were active had significantly lower body weight (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), body fat (BMI, fat mass, % body fat, waist circumference, central and appendicular fat mass, all pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), and measures of insulin resistance (fasting serum insulin and HOMA-IR, both pâ€‰=â€‰0.01), and higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (pâ€‰=â€‰0.041), compared to the inactive group.

"590","The association between daily calcium intake and sarcopenia in older, non-obese Korean adults: the fourth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES IV) 2009.","Endocrine journal","Recent data suggest that variations in calcium intake may influence body weight and composition; however, the relationship between daily calcium intake and muscle mass has not been well established. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between daily calcium intake and sarcopenia. We analyzed data for older adults (over 60 years) from the fourth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) conducted in 2009. A total of 1339 Non-Obese (BMI between 18.5 and 25 kg/mÂ²), older adults (592 men and 707 women) were enrolled. Dietary variables were assessed using a nutrition survey that used a 24-hour recall method. Daily calcium intake based on the consumption of each food item was calculated. Sarcopenia was defined as an appendicular skeletal muscle mass divided by body weight less than 2 SD below the sex-specific mean for young adults. We found that daily calcium intake was negatively correlated with total body fat percentage and positively correlated with appendicular skeletal mass (p<0.001). Participants with sarcopenia appear to have significantly lower daily calcium intakes than participants without sarcopenia (p<0.001). The unadjusted prevalence of sarcopenia according to daily calcium intake tertiles were 6.3%, 4.3%, and 2.7% in tertiles 1, 2, and 3, respectively. After adjustment for age, sex, BMI, total energy intake, and lifestyle factors, compared with those in the lowest tertile of daily calcium intake, participants in the highest tertile had an odds ratio for sarcopenia of 0.295 (95% confidence interval, 0.087-0.768; p for trend = 0.014). We found that daily calcium intake, corrected for total energy intake and serum 25(OH)D status, was significantly lower in subjects with sarcopenia than in those without. Our results suggest a strong inverse association between daily calcium intake and sarcopenia in non-obese, older Korean adults.","23357977","2013",\N

Cancer-specific survival (CSS) stratified by histological subtype, stage, and grade was calculated, and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed.<br />RESULTS: We analyzed a total of 2469 appendiceal adenocarcinomas, of which 1375 had mucinous histology and 860 had nonmucinous histology. Though overall CSS was similar for mucinous and nonmucinous subtypes, differences in stage distribution and stage-stratified CSS were seen. Female sex, stage IV disease, and well-differentiated histology were more common for mucinous adenocarcinomas. Histological grade had a strong prognostic impact, especially in patients with stage IV mucinous adenocarcinoma. The adjusted hazard ratios for stage IV moderately and poorly differentiated histological grade were 1.63 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14-2.34] and 4.94 (95% CI: 3.32-7.35) for mucinous histology, in comparison with 1.44 (95% CI: 0.82-2.52) and 1.90 (95% CI: 0.95-3.80) for nonmucinous histology, respectively.<br />CONCLUSIONS: The strong prognostic impact of histological grade for mucinous adenocarcinomas is primarily restricted to stage IV disease. Stage IV moderately and poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinomas have distinctly different CSS and these data do not support the combination of these 2 histological grades in the recent AJCC Staging Manual 7th edition.","23001080","2013","6"
"592","Sarcopenic obesity as an independent risk factor of hypertension.","Journal of the American Society of Hypertension : JASH","Low muscle mass has been associated with arterial stiffness. The aim of the study was to determine whether sarcopenic obesity is associated with hypertension. Subjects consisted of 6832 adults who participated in the 2009 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Participants were classified as normal, sarcopenic, obese, or sarcopenic-obese based on the following measures: waist circumference and appendicular skeletal muscle mass divided by weight (ASM/Wt). The sarcopenic-obese group had systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels that were â‰ˆ12 mm Hg and 5Â mm Hg higher, respectively, than those in the normal group. Compared with the normal group, the odds ratio (OR) of having hypertension for the sarcopenic, obese, and sarcopenic-obese groups were 2.48 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.89-6.16), 3.15 (95% CI, 2.76-3.59), and 6.42 (95% CI, 4.85-8.48) times higher, respectively. When waist circumference and ASM/Wt were used as continuous variables in the same regression model, ASM/Wt was a significant predictor of hypertension (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89-0.98). Sarcopenic obesity is associated with hypertension, while low muscle mass is also correlated with hypertension, independent of abdominal obesity. Abdominal obesity and sarcopenia may potentiate each other to induce hypertension.","23910010",\N,\N

Parents were counseled regarding 7 potential complications of laparoscopic appendectomy. They were asked to recall this list immediately after the consent process (immediate recall, IR) and before discharge from inpatient stay (delayed recall, DR). A score (0-7) was awarded indicating the number of correct answers. For each recall, parents were also reminded on complications they omitted (prompted recall). One surgeon administered all consents in person. Demographic data were collected. Data were reported as median (range).<br />RESULTS: Twenty-one mothers and 10 fathers were recruited, aged 42 years (30-54). Nine (29%) had university or post-graduate education. Score for IR was 2 (0-6). Five (16%) parents scored 0. Upon prompting after IR, 20 (65%) parents had no impression of at least 1 complication. Score for DR was 2 (0-7), while 7 (23%) parents scored 0. At prompting after DR, 25 (81%) had no memory of at least one complication. Eight (26%) demonstrated improved DR scores. Scores were not affected by patient demographics or time between interviews.<br />CONCLUSIONS: There is poor parental retention of information provided during operative consent.

We aim to develop reference values for body composition and anthropometric measurements in athletes.<br />METHODS: Body weight and height were measured in 898 athletes (264 female, 634 male), anthropometric variables were assessed in 798 athletes (240 female and 558 male), and in 481 athletes (142 female and 339 male) with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). A total of 21 different sports were represented. Reference percentiles (5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th) were calculated for each measured value, stratified by sex and sport. Because sample sizes within a sport were often very low for some outcomes, the percentiles were estimated using a parametric, empirical Bayesian framework that allowed sharing information across sports.<br />RESULTS: We derived sex- and sport-specific reference percentiles for the following DXA outcomes: total (whole body scan) and regional (subtotal, trunk, and appendicular) bone mineral content, bone mineral density, absolute and percentage fat mass, fat-free mass, and lean soft tissue. Additionally, we derived reference percentiles for height-normalized indexes by dividing fat mass, fat-free mass, and appendicular lean soft tissue by height squared. We also derived sex- and sport-specific reference percentiles for the following anthropometry outcomes: weight, height, body mass index, sum of skinfold thicknesses (7 skinfolds, appendicular skinfolds, trunk skinfolds, arm skinfolds, and leg skinfolds), circumferences (hip, arm, midthigh, calf, and abdominal circumferences), and muscle circumferences (arm, thigh, and calf muscle circumferences).<br />CONCLUSIONS: These reference percentiles will be a helpful tool for sports professionals, in both clinical and field settings, for body composition assessment in athletes.","24830292","2014",\N

The two most common etiological factors of acute pancreatitis are gallstones (including small gallstones or microlithiasis) and alcohol abuse. Acute pancreatitis is associated with a significant mortality (4-10%) and 25% in case of pancreatic necrosis, especially. Edematous pancreatitis is benign and oral feeding can be restarted once abdominal pain is decreasing and inflammatory markers are improving. Enteral tube feeding should be the primary therapy in patients with predicted severe acute pancreatitis who require nutritional support. Enteral nutrition in acute pancreatitis can be administered via either the nasojejunal or nasogastric route. In case of necrosis, preventive antibiotics are not recommended. The single indication is infected necrosis confirmed by fine needle aspiration. The incidence trends of acute pancreatitis possibly reflect a change in the prevalence of main etiological factors (e.g. gallstones and alcohol consumption) and cofactors such as tobacco, obesity and genetic susceptibility. Priority is to search for associated causes, especially in cases with atypical symptoms. In case of first acute pancreatitis in patients older than 50 years, the presence of a tumor (benign or malignant) has to be specifically ruled out, using CT-scan, MRI and endoscopic ultrasound.","24837648","2014","10"

This report confirms the arterial destructive potential of C. fetus infection in a peripheral artery.<br />METHODS: An 85-year-old male who had previously undergone endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in 2007 presented with positive blood cultures for C. fetus. No endocarditis was detected. No periprosthetic fluid to suggest aortic endograft infection was present. During hospitalization for sepsis, he developed acute right knee pain and swelling. A 5.2-cm popliteal aneurysm, with contained rupture, was found on ultrasound and confirmed by computed tomography and angiography. Recommendations for treatment and a literature review are provided.<br />RESULTS: This patient was successfully managed with total excision of the aneurysm via a posterior approach with reconstruction through a medial approach using autologous saphenous vein bypass. Culture-directed antibiotic therapy (6Â weeks of intravenous ertapenem) to eradicate the pathogen completed the therapy. The patient is doing well at 18-Â month follow-up.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Mycotic popliteal aneurysm associated with C. fetus is a rare but potentially fatal condition. Isolating C. fetus should alert the surgeon to the peripheral arterial destructive potential of this pathogen, as manifested by acute rupture in this patient. Traditional resection through a posterior approach and revascularization through noncontaminated tissue with culture-directed therapy are the treatments of choice.","24930978","2015","1"

It refined its earlier approach to the classification and management of luminal disease in the absence of amplification or overexpression of the Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) oncogene, while retaining essentially unchanged recommendations for the systemic adjuvant therapy of HER2-positive and 'triple-negative' disease. The Panel again accepted that conventional clinico-pathological factors provided a surrogate subtype classification, while noting that in those areas of the world where multi-gene molecular assays are readily available many clinicians prefer to base chemotherapy decisions for patients with luminal disease on these genomic results rather than the surrogate subtype definitions. Several multi-gene molecular assays were recognized as providing accurate and reproducible prognostic information, and in some cases prediction of response to chemotherapy. Cost and availability preclude their application in many environments at the present time. Broad treatment recommendations are presented. Such recommendations do not imply that each Panel member agrees: indeed, among more than 100 questions, only one (trastuzumab duration) commanded 100% agreement. The various recommendations in fact carried differing degrees of support, as reflected in the nuanced wording of the text below and in the votes recorded in supplementary Appendix S1, available at Annals of Oncology online.

Her medical history was unremarkable. She had no known history of HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases. At the time of presentation, Ms. S.G. had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 related to cancer-related pain. Her appetite and weight were both stable. A complete colonoscopy demonstrated a large, immobile, ulcerated, firm, 4-cm lesion in the distal rectum, arising from the anal canal. Initial staging positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan revealed a hypermetabolic inferior anorectal mass with left perirectal and presacral nodal metastases. There was no definite evidence of distant metastatic disease. Ms. S.G. received chemoradiation treatment following her diagnostic studies, with a total dose of 45 Gy over 26 fractions to the pelvis with concurrent infusional fluorouracil (5-FU; 2, 450 mg over 7 days) and mitomycin C (12 mg/m(2) on day 1) at an outside institution. However, during her chemoradiation therapy, Ms. S.G. experienced a 3-week treatment break due to severe radiation dermatitis, as recommended by her outside treating oncologist. Upon treatment completion, Ms. S.G. underwent a biopsy of the anal canal, which revealed no evidence of residual malignancy. As recommended by her treating oncologist, she received four additional cycles of adjuvant infusional 5-FU in combination with leucovorin. Shortly thereafter, Ms. S.G. developed progressive pelvic pain. She underwent a second PET/CT scan, revealing mixed findings: interval resolution of abnormal standardized uptake value (SUV) activity at the primary tumor in the anal canal, but an increase in the size and SUV of nodal disease within the left perirectal and presacral regions. A CT-guided biopsy noted a perirectal abscess requiring drainage but was inconclusive for disease recurrence; Ms. S.G. was treated with IV antibiotics. Six weeks later, repeat radiographic imaging noted additional changes suspicious for regional recurrence, which was biopsy-confirmed. Ms. S.G. was subsequently referred to MD Anderson Cancer Center for consideration of salvage pelvic exenteration. On physical exam a mass was palpated in the left lower quadrant, but there was no evidence of inguinal adenopathy. On digital rectal exam there was notable external erythema with a fixed mass and moderate sphincter tone. A chest CT scan showed no definite evidence of metastatic disease, but an MRI of the abdomen/pelvis indicated the presence of a complex partially necrotic mass (7.6 Ã— 4.9 Ã— 7.3 cm(3)) extending to the rectosigmoid junction, inseparable from the left lateral bowel wall, with partial encasement of the bowel. In addition, there was infiltration of the left piriformis muscle and cervix consistent with local recurrence. She was referred to medical oncology and radiation oncology for consideration of reirradiation with concurrent neoadjuvant chemotherapy for palliation and possible surgical resection. In early December 2008, Ms. S.G. received intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), with a total dose of 27 Gy over 18 fractions. She received concurrent infusional 5-FU at 300 mg/m(2)/day, from Monday to Friday, on the days of radiation. She also received a weekly bolus dose of cisplatin at 20 mg/m(2). The intent was to treat to 30 Gy, but the patient deferred further treatment early due to anorectal irritation. She then underwent restaging with a PET/CT scan and a pelvic MRI in February 2009, revealing radiographic partial response of the known pelvic recurrence and reduced pelvic pain (Figures 1A and 1B).

"606","Skeletal muscle mass, bone mineral density, and walking performance in masters cyclists.","Rejuvenation research","Exercise mode and intensity/duration are important factors for influencing muscle morphology and function as well as bone. However, it is unknown whether masters cyclists who undergo regular moderate- to high-intensity exercise maintain lower-body skeletal muscle mass (SM) and function and bone health when compared with young adults. The purpose of this study was to compare SM, areal bone mineral density (aBMD), and gait performance between masters cyclists and young adults. Fourteen male masters cyclists (aged 53-71 years) and 13 moderately active young men (aged 20-30 years, exercising less than twice a week) volunteered. The masters cyclists were all training actively (four to five times per week, âˆ¼200 miles per week) for on average the last 17 years (range 7-38 years). Thigh SM was estimated from an ultrasound-derived prediction equation using muscle thickness (MTH). Appendicular lean mass (aLM) and aBMD were also estimated using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. There were no significant differences (p<0.05) in thigh SM, anterior and posterior thigh MTH ratio, or aLM between masters cyclists and young men. Maximum straight and zigzag walking times were also similar between groups. Lumbar spine (L1-L4) aBMD was not different between groups, but femoral neck aBMD was lower (p<0.05) in the cyclists than in the young men. Our results suggest that appendicular as well as site-specific thigh muscle loss with aging were not observed in masters cyclists. This maintenance of muscle mass in masters cyclists may preserve walking performance to similar levels as moderately active young adults. However, long-term cycling does not preserve femoral neck aBMD.","24460174","2014","6"

Early diagnosis and proper surgical precautions must be implemented to prevent iatrogenic rupture of the appendix and the widespread seeding of potentially malignant mucin-producing cells throughout the peritoneal cavity.<br />PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 50-year-old African-American female presented with complaints of left-sided pelvic pain. Pelvic examination revealed adnexal fullness with thickening behind the cervix. An adnexal mass was revealed on ultrasound and MRI. The patient was subsequently taken to the operating room for a planned robotic salpingectomy. During the procedure, she was unexpectedly found to have an abnormally large appendix displaced to the left lower quadrant. General surgery was consulted intra-operatively to perform an appendectomy. The final pathology report revealed a low-grade mucinous adenocarcinoma with mucin dissecting into the wall of the appendix.<br />DISCUSSION: Appendiceal mucinous cystadenomas are characterized by hyperplasia of glandular epithelium along with hypersecretion of mucous resulting in a grossly dilated appendix. The clinical manifestation of appendiceal mucoceles is often non-specific. The prevalence is higher in women than men (4:1) with the average age at the time of diagnosis being 54 years-old.(14-17) Appendiceal mucinous cystadenomas can be particularly problematic for women as these tumors are commonly misdiagnosed pre-operatively as right-sided adnexal masses due to commonalities in clinical presentation and diagnostic findings.(8-12) It is estimated that based on imaging studies only 15-29% of appendiceal mucinous cystadenomas are correctly diagnosed prior to surgical intervention.(13) CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, only one other case of appendiceal adenocarcinoma with left-sided presentation has been reported. Appendiceal carcinomas can create a diagnostic dilemma due to non-specific clinical findings and inadequate imaging studies. Early recognition and careful intra-operative precautions must be taken to maintain the integrity of the appendix to prevent iatrogenic rupture and the spread of potentially malignant mucin-producing cells throughout the peritoneal cavity.","24568943","2014",\N

Significant admission laboratory include blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 108â€‰mg/dL, serum creatinine (Cr) of 23â€‰mg/dL, bicarbonate of 19â€‰mg/dL, and potassium of 6.2â€‰mmL/L. Renal ultrasound showed bilateral hydronephrosis. Post-void residual urine volume was normal. Abdominopelvic CT scan showed retroperitoneal fibrosis confirmed with fine-needle biopsy. He was treated with a combination of bilateral ureteral stent placement, hemodialysis, and steroid therapy. Four months after hospital discharge, his BUN and Cr levels Improved to 18â€‰mg/dL and 1.25â€‰mg/dL, respectively. Conclusion. Retroperitoneal fibrosis should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients with acute renal failure and obstructive uropathy. Abdominal CT scan is the examination of choice for diagnosis. Full resolution with treatment depends on the duration of obstruction.","24533204","2012",\N
"611","Spontaneous bladder rupture diagnosis based on urinary appearance of mesothelial cells: a case report.","Journal of medical case reports","INTRODUCTION: Spontaneous bladder rupture is an extremely rare clinical event that is associated with urinary ascites and apparent acute renal failure. This event is difficult to diagnose clinically, even with advanced techniques such as computed tomography; however, the timely diagnosis of this condition is critical. Here, we report a case of a patient who experienced a spontaneous intraperitoneal bladder rupture 10 years after postoperative pelvic irradiation for the treatment of uterine cancer. In this report of a rare case, we describe the contribution of the appearance of mesothelial cells in the urine to the diagnosis of this condition.<br />CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was a 71-year-old Asian woman who experienced lower abdominal pain and vomiting of two days duration. On admission, abdominal computed tomography showed intraperitoneal fluid collection and her blood tests revealed acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. She underwent hemodialysis and a transurethral catheter was inserted. The transurethral catheter was removed three days after her admission. Four days after the catheter removal, her symptoms recurred and her serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels were elevated. We noted the presence of mesothelial cells in her urine, which led to a diagnosis of intraperitoneal bladder rupture. She underwent surgical repair of her bladder and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and was discharged after her renal function returned to normal.<br />CONCLUSION: Urine analysis is a simple and non-invasive test and we believe that a thorough urine analysis may contribute to the early diagnosis of an intraperitoneal bladder rupture. We think that the findings presented in this case report will significantly enhance our understanding of the etiology of bladder rupture. Moreover, these case findings may help nephrologists and urologists to rapidly diagnose this condition.","24521453","2014",\N

We encountered a 50-year-old woman with months of nonspecific abdominal pain and presented with signs and symptoms of acute renal failure. Laboratory data was significant for blood urea nitrogen 47â€‰mg/dL and creatinine of 8.47â€‰mg/dL. Renal ultrasound revealed bilateral hydronephrosis and an abdominal computed tomogram confirmed an abnormal soft tissue retroperitoneal confluence that encased the pelvic vessels. Urologic consultation was requested and bilateral ureteral stents were placed with relief of her obstructive uropathy. Five days after ureteral stenting her creatinine dropped to 1.64â€‰mg/dL. One month later patient underwent ureterolysis with biopsy showing fibroblast proliferation consistent with acute and chronic inflammation. By ruling out infections and malignancy, the final diagnosis was made to be idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis.","24527236","2011",\N
"614","Relationships between IgE/IgG4 epitopes, structure and function in Anisakis simplex Ani s 5, a member of the SXP/RAL-2 protein family.","PLoS neglected tropical diseases","BACKGROUND: Anisakiasis is a re-emerging global disease caused by consumption of raw or lightly cooked fish contaminated with L3 Anisakis larvae. This zoonotic disease is characterized by severe gastrointestinal and/or allergic symptoms which may misdiagnosed as appendicitis, gastric ulcer or other food allergies. The Anisakis allergen Ani s 5 is a protein belonging to the SXP/RAL-2 family; it is detected exclusively in nematodes. Previous studies showed that SXP/RAL-2 proteins are active antigens; however, their structure and function remain unknown. The aim of this study was to elucidate the three-dimensional structure of Ani s 5 and its main IgE and IgG4 binding regions.<br />METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The tertiary structure of recombinant Ani s 5 in solution was solved by nuclear magnetic resonance. Mg2+, but not Ca2+, binding was determined by band shift using SDS-PAGE. IgE and IgG4 epitopes were elucidated by microarray immunoassay and SPOTs membranes using sera from nine Anisakis allergic patients. The tertiary structure of Ani s 5 is composed of six alpha helices (H), with a Calmodulin like fold. H3 is a long, central helix that organizes the structure, with H1 and H2 packing at its N-terminus and H4 and H5 packing at its C-terminus. The orientation of H6 is undefined. Regarding epitopes recognized by IgE and IgG4 immunoglobulins, the same eleven peptides derived from Ani s 5 were bound by both IgE and IgG4. Peptides 14 (L40-K59), 26 (A76-A95) and 35 (I103-D122) were recognized by three out of nine sera.<br />CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first reported 3D structure of an Anisakis allergen. Magnesium ion binding and structural resemblance to Calmodulin, suggest some putative functions for SXP/RAL-2 proteins. Furthermore, the IgE/IgG4 binding regions of Ani s 5 were identified as segments localized on its surface. These data will contribute towards a better understanding of the interactions that occur between immunoglobulins and allergens and, in turn, facilitate the design of novel diagnostic tests and immunotherapeutic strategies.","24603892","2014","3"

In this case report, we describe gossypiboma in the abdominal cavity which was detected 14 months after the hysterectomy due to acute abdominal pain. Gossypiboma was diagnosed by computed tomography (CT). The CT findings were a rounded mass with a dense central part and an enhancing wall. In explorative laparotomy, small bowel loops were seen to be perforated due to inflammation of long standing gossypiboma. Jejunal resection with end-to-end anastomosis was performed. The patient was discharged whithout complication. This case was presented to point to retained foreign body (RFB) complications and we believed that the possibility of a retained foreign body should be considered in the differential diagnosis of who had previous surgery and complained of pain, infection, or palpable mass.","24288645","2013",\N

Presentations are often delayed, and manifestations can be nonspecific. Fever is the most common symptom followed by abdominal pain, and hepatomegaly is the most common abnormality found on clinical examination. Abnormalities of the liver function tests are non-specific and hence not diagnostic. Ultrasound or computed tomography reveals single or complex masses, and guided biopsy is diagnostic either by demonstrating caseating granuloma or the organism by staining and culture. Treatment is with standard first-line antituberculous drugs. Endoscopic stenting gives an excellent outcome for symptomatic biliary strictures. The outcome in patients infected with Human Immunodeficiency virus depends on the level of underlying immunosuppression.","24640207","2013","6"

Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences","BACKGROUND: Diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia from appendicular lean mass (ALM), strength, and performance have been proposed, but little is known regarding the progression of sarcopenia. We examined the time course of sarcopenia and determinants of transitioning toward and away from sarcopenia.<br />METHODS: ALM, gait speed, and grip strength were assessed seven times over 9 years in 2,928 initially well-functioning adults aged 70-79. Low ALM was defined as less than 7.95 kg/m(2) (men) or less than 6.24 kg/m(2) (women), low performance as gait speed less than 1.0 m/s, low strength as grip strength less than 30 kg (men) or less than 20 kg (women). Presarcopenia was defined as low ALM and sarcopenia as low ALM with low performance or low strength. Hidden Markov modeling was used to characterize states of ALM, strength, and performance and model transitions leading to sarcopenia and death. Determinants of transitioning toward and away from sarcopenia were examined with logistic regression.<br />RESULTS: Initially, 54% of participants had normal ALM, strength, and performance; 21% had presarcopenia; 5% had sarcopenia; and 20% had intermediate characteristics. Of participants with normal ALM, strength, and performance, 1% transitioned to presarcopenia and none transitioned to sarcopenia. The greatest transition to sarcopenia (7%) was in presarcopenic individuals. Low-functioning and sarcopenia states were more likely to lead to death (12% and 13%). Higher body mass index (p < .001) and pain (p = .05) predicted transition toward sarcopenia, whereas moderate activity predicted transition from presarcopenia to more normal states (p = .02).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Pain, physical activity, and body mass index, potentially modifiable factors, are determinants of transitions. Promotion of health approaching old age is important as few individuals transition away from their initial state.","24013673","2014","6"
"618","Primary appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma mimicking bladder carcinoma: A case report and review of the literature.","Oncology letters","Primary appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma is a rare entity, while appendiceal carcinoma invading the urinary bladder is even rarer. The current study presents the case of a 54-year-old male with primary appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, without gastrointestinal symptoms, presenting only with signs of bladder irritation. Abdominal computed tomography scans demonstrated a mass at the right anterior level of the bladder. During intraoperative exploration, the mass was detected to connect and adhere to the ileocecal junction, and normal appendix tissues were not found. The frozen section revealed a mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix and the patient immediately underwent a subsequent hemicolectomy. The present case indicates that a diagnosis of a primary appendiceal mucinous carcinoma must considered by radiologists and clinicians for patients who do not exhibit gastrointestinal symptoms, but show involvement of the nearest organs and the bladder wall.","24944705","2014","4"

"623","Universal neonatal hearing screening in Flanders reveals socio-demographic risk factors for hearing impairment.","B-ENT","INTRODUCTION: Permanent congenital hearing impairment (CHI) occurs in approximately 1.4 per 1,000 newborns. Early treatment and rehabilitation is essential to prevent the delayed development of speech and language. This paper describes the special collaborative approach of the Flemish screening programme. It also discusses the results and the new insights into socio-demographic risk factors for CHI.<br />METHODS: In the period 1999-2008, the entire population of 628,337 newborns in Flanders was tested using an AABR hearing screener. Positive results were referred for confirmation of the CHI diagnosis to specialised referral centres. Socio-demographic factors were investigated to study any relationship with CHI.<br />RESULTS: The referral rate after two screenings was 2.7-7.2 per thousand of screened babies depending on the screener used. All children were referred to specialised centres and there was almost no loss to follow-up. The diagnosis of hearing loss was confirmed in 77-82% of the babies referred. The socio-demographic factors of gender, birth order and birth length, initial feeding type, level of education and origin of the mother were found to be independent predictors of CHI. Most of these risk factors can be linked to poverty. The observation that 50% of babies with CHI have no risk factors from the classic AAP list may be partly explained by the non-inclusion of socio-demographic risk factors.<br />CONCLUSIONS: This integrated programme opens up new perspectives for hearing-impaired babies. The social impact of the screening programme is considerable. A cluster of socio-demographic risk factors for CHI can be added to the classic AAP list.","24383217","2013",\N

The aim of this study was to correlate the number of words with measures of quality, to examine the impact of the drive for improved quality on the workload of histopathology reporting over time.<br />METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the first 10 reports of colon, breast, renal, lung and ovarian carcinoma, melanoma resection, nodal lymphoma appendicitis and seborrhoeic keratosis (SK) issued in 1991, 2001 and 2011. Correlations were analysed using Pearson's partial correlation coefficients. Word count increased significantly over time for most specimen types examined. Word count almost always correlated with units of information, indicating that the word count was a good measure of the amount of information contained within the reports; this correlation was preserved following correction for the effect of time. A good correlation with compliance with cancer datasets was also observed, but was weakened or lost following correction for the increase in word count and units of information that occurred between time points.<br />CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that word count could potentially be used as a measure of information content if its integrity and usefulness are continuously validated. Further prospective studies are required to assess and validate this approach.","23701471","2013","7"

Poisson regression analyses were used to determine whether current eGFR or %FU of 60 ml/min or less were independent prognostic markers for clinical events.<br />RESULTS: During 61 425 person-years of follow-up (PYFU), the crude incidence of deaths was 11.1/1000 PYFU [95% confidence interval (CI) 10.0-12.1] at current eGFR more than 90 ml/min and 199.6 (95% CI 1144.3-254.3/1000 PYFU) when current eGFR was 30 ml/min or less. Corresponding figures for AIDS were 12.2 (11.1-13.3) and 63.9 (36.5-103.7) and for non-AIDS were 16.0 (14.8-17.3) and 203.6 (147.7-259.5). After adjustment, current eGFR of 30 ml/min or less was a strong predictor of death [adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRR) 4.35; 95% CI 3.20-5.91] and non-AIDS events (3.63; 95% CI 2.57-5.13), although the relationship with AIDS was less strong (1.45; 95% CI 1.01-2.08). After adjustment, %FU of 60 ml/min or less was associated with a 22% increased incidence of death (aIRR 1.22 per 10% longer; 95% CI 1.18-1.27), a 13% increased incidence of non-AIDS events (95% CI 1.08-1.18) and a 15% increased incidence of AIDS events (95% CI 1.06-1.24).<br />CONCLUSION: Both current eGFR and %FU of 60 ml/min or less were associated with death and non-AIDS events in HIV-positive persons.

The role of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) in controlling malignant ascites is not well defined.<br />METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of 1,000 procedures was performed. Type of malignancy, resolution of ascites, duration and agent of chemoperfusion, performance status, resection status, morbidity, mortality, and survival were reviewed.<br />RESULTS: Ascites was found in 299 patients (310 procedures) either before or during exploration. A total of 142 (46 %) procedures were performed for appendiceal primary disease, 53 (17 %) colorectal, 20 (6 %) gastric, 45 (15 %) mesothelioma, and 26 (8 %) ovarian. A total of 288 (93 %) patients had resolution of ascites by 3 months' follow-up. In patients with ascites, complete cytoreduction was obtained in 15 versus 59 % when ascites was not present (p < 0.001). In the group of patients who had their ascites controlled, 243 of 288 (84 %) had resection with residual macroscopic disease (R2 status). Twenty-two patients (7 %) had persistent ascites at 3 months' follow-up, 19 (86 %) of whom had an R2 resection. Univariate analysis revealed that type of primary disease, resection status, duration or agent of chemoperfusion, and performance status did not predict failure.<br />CONCLUSIONS: CRS-HIPEC is effective in controlling ascites in 93 % of patients with malignant ascites, even when a complete cytoreduction is not feasible. Ascites is predictive of incomplete cytoreduction and worse overall survival. Although complete cytoreduction remains the goal of this procedure, HIPEC can provide palliative value in selected patients with malignant ascites.","23982251","2014","5"

We performed a retrospective cohort study of all children with HSP admitted during a 15 years period to a single pediatric department. We strictly collected the clinical data of all HSP cases. Each case was categorized as either \"necessary admission\" or \"unnecessary admission.\" We compared the two groups, using initially Chi square (Ï‡(2)) and student \"t\" tests, and thereafter, we employed logistic stepwise regression analysis. One hundred and sixty-three children with HSP were included. A set of six clinical criteria of which the presence of minimum one predicts the need for hospitalization were identified including: orchitis, moderate or severe abdominal pain, arthritis involving more than two joints, proteinuria, clear evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, and inability to ambulate. In conclusion, we suggest a predictive model for the admission of pediatric patients with acute HSP. The implementation of this model can significantly reduce unnecessary admissions.","24563020","2014","11"

All the patients were from (or descended from) high-risk ethnic groups. Four had co-existing pulmonary TB. Intestinal and peritoneal TB were the most common findings. The most common clinical manifestations included abdominal pain (71%), weight loss (59%), diarrhoea (47%) and pyrexia (41%). Fifteen patients had samples sent for microbiological investigation; 1 (6%) was smear positive and 9 (53%) were culture positive. Two (12%) were isoniazid resistant. No rifampicin resistance was detected. Anti-tuberculous therapy was given for 6-12 months. In total, 16 (94%) patients completed the treatment; 1 patient died prior to regime completion (crude mortality: 6%). There was one reported case of pyrazinamide intolerance and two episodes of isoniazid intolerance.<br />DISCUSSION: ATB is a diagnostic challenge, especially in absence of lung involvement. It mimics other diseases and clinical presentation is usually non-specific, which may lead to diagnostic delay and development of complications. Extreme vigilance should be used when dealing with unexplained abdominal symptoms to ensure timely diagnosis of ATB.

Chylous ascites was incidentally discovered on exploratory laparotomy. The chylous fluid was drained, the small bowel detorted and the coloduodenal adhesion band taken down. The patient's retroperitoneum was explored to exclude occult masses and malformations of the lymphatics. Post surgery, the patient recovered uneventfully. In this case, we postulate that intestinal malrotation had caused the obstruction of the lymphatic flow from the mesenteric lymphatic channels, leading to the exudation of chyle, which then resulted in the accumulation of chylous fluid in the peritoneal cavity. It is important to exclude the more common causes of atraumatic chylous ascites, such as enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes or lymphatic malformations.","23624462","2013","4"

We observed a higher fracture rate for osteoarticular allografts, but other specific complication rates were similar.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Owing to the limitations of our systematic review, we found that allograft-prosthesis composites and prostheses seem to have similar functional outcome and survival rates, and both seem to avoid fractures that are observed with osteoarticular allografts. Further collaboration in the field of surgical oncology, using randomized controlled trials, is required to establish the superiority of any particular treatment.","24469551","2014","7"
"635","[Gastrointestinal locations of primary melanoma].","Magyar sebÃ©szet","Primary gastrointestinal melanomas, part of the mucosal melanoma group, are uncommon. They constitute about five percent of all melanomas and most of them are located in the rectum (3 percent of all melanomas). The prognosis is poor, overall 5-year survival in rectal melanoma is 10-20 percent. We present three of our cases. The first case - a 68-year-old male patient - was operated on for histologically proved rectal melanoma. Three years after radical excision and oncological treatment a metastasis of the primary tumor was diagnosed in the stomach. Total gastrectomy was performed, followed by oncological treatment. In the second case of a 59-year-old male patient an appendectomy was performed for symptoms of appendicitis. The histopathological examination revealed melanoma of the appendix. Further investigations revealed the primary tumor in the stomach and metastases in the lungs as well. The third case - an 82-year-old female patient - was investigated for frequent defecations, mucus in stool and fecal incontinence. Primary melanoma was proved in the lower third of the rectum with multiple hepatic metastases. These three cases in our practice are remarkable for the rarity of the disease, and in two cases the presence of both the primary tumor and the metastasis were located in the gastrointestinal tract.","24566654","2014","2"

We report our single-center experience during the last 9Â years, evaluating the outcomes after endovascular repair in this patient population.<br />METHODS: All patients with a diagnosis of IAAAD treated in our institute were included in this retrospective review. Between January 2004 and December 2012, 38 patients suffering from an acute aortic dissection were referred regionally for intervention to our department: 24 (63.2%) with a thoracic aortic dissection type B and 14 patients (36.8%, all male; median age, 65Â years) with an IAAAD. Demographics, perioperative, procedure-specific, and follow-up data were prospectively aggregated in an electronic database.<br />RESULTS: Patients suffering from IAAAD presented with acute abdominal pain (nÂ = 13) and acute lumbar pain (nÂ = 1). Insufferable pain and enlargement of the aorta were the main indications for treatment. Mean (Â± standard deviation) maximal abdominal aortic diameter at presentation was 3.5Â Â± 0.94Â cm (range, 2.6-5.1Â cm). None of these patients had a concomitant thoracic aortic dissection. All patients were treated by endovascular means, with a primary technical success rate of 100%. Two patients (14%) died perioperatively from cardiac causes. Median hospital stay was 4.5Â days (range, 3-16Â days). During a mean follow-up period of 37.41Â Â± 23.56Â months (range, 8-82Â months; median, 32.5Â months), two patients experienced primary treatment failure needing reintervention that led to a successful outcome. The cumulative free-from-reintervention rate was estimated 90.9% at 58Â months (standard error, 8.7%). A full aortic remodeling without any events was noted in all other patients during the follow-up period.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Based on our series, IAAAD may represent a not so rare clinical entity as generally thought, suggesting that it may be underdiagnosed. Endovascular treatment of IAAAD appears to be a feasible and efficient therapeutic approach and might be considered as the first-line treatment in all patients with suitable anatomy.","23830158","2013","12"

Neurogenic stunned myocardium (NSM) is a reversible cardiomyopathy resulting in transient left ventricular apical ballooning presumed to result from catecholamine surge occurring under physiologic stress. Acute spinal cord ischemia is a rare ischemic vascular lesion. We report a case of neurogenic stunned myocardium occurring in the setting of acute spinal cord infarction. Methods. Singe case report was used. Results. We present the case of a 63-year-old female with a history of prior lacunar stroke, hypertension, chronic back pain, and hypothyroidism who presented with a brief episode of diffuse abdominal and bilateral lower extremity pain which progressed within minutes to bilateral lower extremity flaccid paralysis. MRI of the spinal cord revealed central signal hyperintensity of T2-weighted imaging from conus to T8 region, concerning for acute spinal cord ischemia. Transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to determine if a cardiac embolic phenomenon may have precipitated this ischemic event and showed left ventricular apical hypokinesis and ballooning concerning for NSM. Conclusion. Neurogenic stunned myocardium is a reversible cardiomyopathy which has been described in patients with physiologic stress resulting in ventricular apical ballooning. Our case suggests that it is possible for neurogenic stunned myocardium to occur in the setting of acute spinal cord ischemia.","24804117","2012",\N

The affected side is represented by a trunk (proboscis) which can be positioned from the upper eyelid down to the alar base. We present two cases of proboscis lateralis, one in which we reconstructed an airway. The first case is a 16-year-old male patient who presented with heminasal aplasia. Immediately after birth, a proboscis lateralis was resected from the right upper eyelid as primary treatment elsewhere. We reconstructed the nose using costal cartilage as framework. A paramedian forehead flap was transposed to give the patient a nose with adult dimensions. We made no attempt to reconstruct an airway in this case as unilateral nasal breathing appeared adequate. The second case is a 14-year-old male patient who presented with heminasal aplasia on his right side, where a nodule-like appendix was existent with a fistula underneath. A computed tomographic scan revealed an existing hypoplastic posterior nasal airway and a complete ventilated sinus system. The fact that there was an existing posterior airway encouraged us to construct an anterior airway to create an airflow passage. Costal cartilage was taken for framework reconstruction and nasal skin was completely replaced by a paramedian forehead flap. The reconstructed airflow passage was stable.","24918715","2014","6"
"640","Clinical and radiologic course of symptomatic spontaneous isolated dissection of the superior mesenteric artery treated with conservative management.","Journal of vascular surgery","OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical and radiological outcomes of patients with symptomatic spontaneous isolated dissection of the superior mesenteric artery (SIDSMA) who were treated with conservative management.<br />METHODS: This retrospective study included 27 consecutive patients who were diagnosed with symptomatic SIDSMA and managed conservatively from April 2007 to April 2013. Twenty-six patients were treated using anticoagulation therapy, and one patient with chronic liver disease underwent observation only. For evaluation, patients were divided into two groups, those with a patent false lumen with both entry and re-entry (group I), and those with partial or complete thrombosis of the false lumen (group II). In general, the patients underwent follow-up computed tomography angiography (CTA) 1 week, 1 month, and 6 months after admission. Thereafter, they underwent annual CTAs.<br />RESULTS: There were five group I and 22 group II patients. During hospitalization, none of the patients needed additional endovascular or surgical intervention, and after conservative management, every patient was asymptomatic upon discharge. The mean duration of clinical follow-up was 27.3 months. There was no recurrent abdominal pain associated with SIDSMA, and no invasive procedures due to SIDSMA were needed. During a mean of 17.1 months of CTA follow-up in group I patients, serial CTAs found sustained patent false lumen and no angiographic changes in all patients. Among 22 group II patients, despite anticoagulation and symptomatic relief, CTA 1 week after admission revealed increased stenosis of the true lumen in 84.2% (16/19) of patients including six cases of progressive SMA occlusion. Five patients, including the three patients initially presenting with SMA occlusion, had no interval changes, and only one patient had improved compression of the true lumen. During a mean of 18.0 months of CTA follow-up in group II patients, serial CTAs revealed improvement in the occlusion or stenosis of the true lumen in 89% (16/18) of patients and progressive resolution of false lumen thrombosis in all patients. Aneurysmal dilatation greater than 2 cm was not detected in either group of patients during follow-up.<br />CONCLUSIONS: During the acute stage of SIDSMA, we found a discrepancy between the clinical and angiographic findings. The therapeutic regimen should be based on clinical symptoms, and conservative management is feasible in most cases. SMA stenosis could not be an indication for invasive treatment, because stenosis of the true lumen has been seen to improve after the acute stage of dissection.","24080130","2014","2"

We report a rare case of acute necrotizing colitis due to sigmoid colon cancer, in which shock status occurred within ten hours of onset. A 79-year-old female with acute abdominal pain was transported to our hospital with acute shock. Abdominal enhanced computed tomography revealed thickening of the wall of the sigmoid colon and marked dilation of the proximal colon. Emergency surgery was performed with the intraoperative findings of severe sigmoid colon stenosis and proximal dilation of the colon without perforation, and a large volume of putrid ascitic fluid. The intestine was proximally dilated and black in color, from the sigmoid colon to the ileum 60 cm proximal to the terminal ileum, suggesting acute necrosis. Total colectomy with 80 cm resection of terminal ileum and ileostomy was performed. Whereas acute necrotizing colitis is a rare condition and its etiology remains obscure, the chronic ischemic state must play some role. Our patient was of advanced age and had diabetes mellitus and hypertension. These factors might lead to a chronic ischemic state of the bowel due to arteriosclerosis. In addition to the underlying condition, massive bacterial reflux into the ileum from the colon might cause the capillary vasoconstriction of the bowel that led to her critical state.","24460766","2014",\N

We hypothesized that early abdominal closure after DCL improves long-term outcomes.<br />METHODS: Patients (2005-2011) who underwent DCL (n = 140) at our Level I trauma center were identified. A total of 108 patients survived their hospitalization, and 15 died following discharge. Of the remaining 93 survivors, 59 were unreachable and not present in the social security death index. Our final study population of 34 survivors prospectively completed a standardized study questionnaire, the SF-36 health survey, and inpatient and outpatient records were reviewed. Survivors were compared on the basis of time with final abdominal closure (early, <7 days vs. late, >7 days; either primary closure or Vicryl mesh), and study variables were analyzed. A p < 0.05 was considered significant.<br />RESULTS: Our study population was primarily male (82%) of varying age (36 [13]) and mechanism (blunt 56%, penetrating 44%) with severe injuries (mean [SD] Injury Severity Score [ISS], 17 [8]). Despite no differences in age, sex, mechanism, ISS, admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, or admission systolic blood pressure, early-closure patients (n = 13) had shorter hospital (25 days vs. 57 days) and intensive care unit (12 days vs. 20 days) stays and, upon long-term follow-up, higher physical (54 vs. 18), emotional (86 vs. 44), and general health (66 vs. 50) SF-36 scores than late-closure patients (n = 21) (all p < 0.05). Early-closure patients had less daily pain (38% vs. 95%), had higher overall SF-36 scores (66 vs. 46), and were more likely to return to work (54% vs. 10%) than late-closure patients (all p < 0.05).<br />CONCLUSION: Early clinical decisions impact the lives of critically injured patients.

In both, radionuclide imaging still represent a cornerstone of diagnostic imaging, although the involved techniques are more or less the same from the early '80â€‰s. During the last 2 decades, published papers focused on a deep revision about the optimal use and usefulness of such imaging tools in affected children, with the aim of reducing invasiveness, radiation burden and costs without losing efficacy. This approach leads to different results. In UCA, no consensus for a diagnostic algorithm was up to now reached, whilst, about febrile UTIs, guidelines were published in 2007 by the UK's National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) and by the European Society of Paediatric Radiology (ESPR), in 2011 by the American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP), and in 2012 by the Italian Society of Paediatric Nephrology (SINP). Nevertheless, new data continuously arise and the scientific debate always revives. Every imaging tool now available has its own strengths and weaknesses, and so all published guidelines.

"648","Beyond acute appendicitis: imaging and pathologic spectrum of appendiceal pathology.","Emergency radiology","While acute appendicitis is a common and important clinical problem, a variety of other disease processes can affect the appendix. Simple and perforated appendicitis, tip appendicitis, and stump appendicitis share a common clinical presentation including anorexia, right lower quadrant pain, and fever. By imaging, most cases of acute appendicitis exhibit luminal dilation, wall thickening, and periappendiceal inflammatory stranding. In tip appendicitis, these changes are isolated to the distal appendix, often with an obstructing appendicolith. Perforated appendicitisÂ can exhibit mural discontinuity, periappendiceal abscess, and/or extraluminal appendicoliths. After appendectomy, the appendiceal remnant or \"stump\" can become inflamed, often necessitating repeat surgery. Inflammatory bowel disease can involve the terminal ileum, secondarily involving the appendix, or may primarily involve the appendix. Patient symptoms can be chronic in such cases, and mucosal hyperenhancement is a pronounced imaging feature. In asymptomatic patients without appendiceal inflammation, the appendix can be dilated by intraluminal material such as inspissated succus in cystic fibrosis or mucus from benign appendiceal mucocele. Finally, neoplasms such as typical appendiceal carcinoid tumor and mucinous adenocarcinoma can involve the appendix. Carcinoids are often small and incidentally discovered at pathologic examination, while malignant mucinous adenocarcinoma tends to present with advanced disease including pseudomyxoma peritonei. Cecal cancers can also obstruct the appendiceal lumen and cause acute appendicitis; an astute radiologist can recognize this prospectively and facilitate definitive resection (right hemicolectomy) at the time of surgery. Attention to mural features, cecal configuration, and periappendiceal inflammation is essential to the correct prospective diagnosis of complicated appendicitis and less common appendiceal pathologies.","24414145","2014","10"

American journal of roentgenology","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of using CT to differentiate malignant from benign lesions in patients with pathologically confirmed appendiceal mucoceles.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: CT scans of 18 consecutively registered patients (11 men, seven women; age range, 21-78 years) with pathologically confirmed appendiceal mucocele were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were classified into three groups according to pathologic results: nonneoplastic mucocele (n = 3), mucinous cystadenoma (n = 10), and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma (n = 5). The nonneoplastic and mucinous cystadenoma groups were formed into a benign group, and the mucinous cystadenocarcinoma constituted the malignant group. Two experienced radiologists working in consensus assessed the shape, short diameter, density, contour, and wall thickness of the masses. The presence of calcifications, internal septations, soft-tissue thickening, periappendiceal fat stranding, intraperitoneal free fluid and pseudomyxoma peritonei were also evaluated. The CT results were compared for malignant and benign appendiceal mucoceles.<br />RESULTS: CT showed statistically significant differences in wall irregularity and soft-tissue thickening between malignant and benign cases (p < 0.05). Short diameter of mucoceles, attenuation of intraluminal contents, maximal wall thickness, calcifications, internal septations, periappendiceal fat stranding, intraperitoneal free fluid, and pseudomyxoma peritonei in the lesions did not differ significantly between the benign and malignant groups (p > 0.05).<br />CONCLUSION: Differentiating malignant from benign mucoceles can be difficult with CT. Irregular walls and soft-tissue thickening are features most likely to be associated with malignancy.","24059397","2013","10"

We compared 2 laparoscopic approaches for treating appendicitis and evaluated postoperative pain, complications and time to full recovery.<br />METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of consecutive patients with appendicitis and compared those who underwent conventional laparoscopic appendectomy (CLA) performed using 3 incisions and those who underwent single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy (SILA). During SILA, the single port was prepared to increase visibility of the operative site.<br />RESULTS: Our analysis included 688 consecutive patients: 618 who underwent CLA and 70 who underwent SILA. Postsurgical complications occurred more frequently in the CLA than the SILA group (18.1% v. 7.1%, p = 0.018). Patients who underwent SILA returned to oral feeding sooner than those who underwent CLA (median 12 h v. 22 h, p < 0.001).

"657","Genome-wide mutational landscape of mucinous carcinomatosis peritonei of appendiceal origin.","Genome medicine","BACKGROUND: Mucinous neoplasms of the appendix (MNA) are rare tumors which may progress from benign to malignant disease with an aggressive biological behavior. MNA is often diagnosed after metastasis to the peritoneal surfaces resulting in mucinous carcinomatosis peritonei (MCP). Genetic alterations in MNA are poorly characterized due to its low incidence, the hypo-cellularity of MCPs, and a lack of relevant pre-clinical models. As such, application of targeted therapies to this disease is limited to those developed for colorectal cancer and not based on molecular rationale.<br />METHODS: We sequenced the whole exomes of 10 MCPs of appendiceal origin to identify genome-wide somatic mutations and copy number aberrations and validated significant findings in 19 additional cases.<br />RESULTS: Our study demonstrates that MNA has a different molecular makeup than colorectal cancer. Most tumors have co-existing oncogenic mutations in KRAS (26/29) and GNAS (20/29) and are characterized by downstream PKA activation. High-grade tumors are GNAS wild-type (5/6), suggesting they do not progress from low-grade tumors. MNAs do share some genetic alterations with colorectal cancer including gain of 1q (5/10), Wnt, and TGFÎ² pathway alterations. In contrast, mutations in TP53 (1/10) and APC (0/10), common in colorectal cancer, are rare in MNA. Concurrent activation of the KRAS and GNAS mediated signaling pathways appears to be shared with pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm.<br />CONCLUSIONS: MNA genome-wide mutational analysis reveals genetic alterations distinct from colorectal cancer, in support of its unique pathophysiology and suggests new targeted therapeutic opportunities.","24944587","2014",\N

"660","Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome: An Emerging Drug-Induced Disease.","American journal of therapeutics","Cannabinoid hyperemesis is a relatively rare but significant adverse effect of chronic marijuana use characterized by severe, cyclic nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain and marked by compulsive hot-water bathing for temporary symptom relief. A 37-year-old African American male with no significant medical history other than the habitual abuse of marijuana was admitted for intractable nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. With the exception of abdominal skin hyperpigmentation and scarring secondary to the direct application of heat through a heating pad, physical examination of the abdomen was unremarkable. Laboratory studies revealed a mild leukocytosis and acute renal dysfunction. All diagnostic examinations were found to be unremarkable or noncontributory to the patient's presenting state. Consistent with previous admissions, the patient's urine toxicology screening was found to be positive for marijuana. After several days of aggressive IV fluid hydration and as needed antiemetics and pain management, all laboratory studies and vital signs returned to baseline and the patient was subsequently discharged. Symptoms of cannabinoid hyperemesis resolve with cannabis cessation and recur when cannabis use is reinitiated, supporting an association between chronic use and cyclic vomiting. A Naranjo algorithm score of 5 revealed a probable incidence of cyclic vomiting associated with chronic cannabis abuse in our patient. Marijuana use, both legal and illegal, is becoming more prevalent in the United States. Given the nationwide increase in marijuana use for recreational and medical reasons, pharmacists and other health care providers should be aware of this interesting drug-induced phenomenon.","24413371","2014","1"
"661","Assessment of active play, inactivity and perceived barriers in an inner city neighborhood.","Journal of community health","Avondale, a disadvantaged neighborhood in Cincinnati, lags behind on a number of indicators of child well-being. Childhood obesity has become increasingly prevalent, as one-third of Avondale's kindergarteners are obese or overweight. The study objective was to determine perceptions of the quantity of and obstacles to childhood physical activity in the Avondale community. Caregivers of children from two elementary schools were surveyed to assess their child's physical activity and barriers to being active. Three hundred and forty surveys were returned out of 1,047 for a response rate of 32%. On school days, 41% of caregivers reported that their children spent more than 2 h watching television, playing video games, or spending time on the computer. While over half of respondents reported that their children get more than 2 h of physical activity on school days, 14% of children were reported to be physically active less than 1 h per day. Caregivers identified violence, cost of extracurricular activities, and lack of organized activities as barriers to their child's physical activity. The overwhelming majority of caregivers expressed interest in a program to make local playgrounds safer. In conclusion, children in Avondale are not participating in enough physical activity and are exposed to more screen time than is recommended by the AAP. Safety concerns were identified as a critical barrier to address in future advocacy efforts in this community. This project represents an important step toward increasing the physical activity of children in Avondale and engaging the local community.","24306236","2014","6"

The Association of American Medical Colleges has recommended that a student's class ranking be included in the summary paragraph of the MSPE and that this information be repeated in a supplementary appendix.<br />METHODS: The authors reviewed the MSPEs from 1,479 applications for residency training positions. The aim was to determine to what extent and in what manner individual schools reveal how their students perform relative to their peers. The authors then set out to create a database containing this information.<br />RESULTS: Working from a list of 141 US members of the Association of American Medical Colleges, complete information for 107 schools (76%) and partial information for the remaining 34 schools (24%) was gathered. Only 12 schools (9%) included complete comparative information in the summary section in accordance with the guidelines of the Association of American Medical Colleges. Other schools were in partial compliance or did not comply at all. The database the authors constructed will inform users if comparative information is available, guide users to its location in the MSPE, and explain the meaning of the language different schools use to rank or classify their students.<br />CONCLUSIONS: The authors recognize that this database is incomplete and that the individual institutions will alter their ranking system from time to time. But this database is offered in an open format so that it can be continuously updated by users.","24713497","2014","6"

"664","Initial experience with same day discharge after laparoscopic appendectomy for nonperforated appendicitis.","The Journal of surgical research","BACKGROUND: Although many laparoscopic procedures are performed on an outpatient basis, patients who have undergone a laparoscopic appendectomy have typically stayed at least overnight. Recently, data in both the pediatric and adult literature suggest that same day discharge (SDD) for acute nonperforated appendicitis is safe and associated with high patient and parent satisfaction. We have recently begun attempting SDD for nonperforated appendicitis, and this study is an analysis of our initial experience.<br />METHODS: A retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for nonperforated appendicitis at our institution from January 2012 to July 2013 was performed. Demographics, length of stay, hospital course, and outcomes were measured. Data are expressed as meanÂ±standard deviation. Comparative analysis was performed using a t-test.<br />RESULTS: A total of 588 laparoscopic appendectomies for nonperforated appendicitis were performed over an 18-mo period. Approximately 28% (n=128) were discharged on the day of surgery. Of the remaining patients, 12.9% (n=59) stayed overnight for medical reasons, 0.4% (n=2) stayed for social reasons, 3.9% (n=18) stayed because the operation ended late in the evening, and 82.8% (n=381) stayed because of clinical care habits. Compared with patients who stayed overnight, there was no statistically significant difference in readmission rates (0.7% versus 1.9%, P=0.6%), follow-up before scheduled appointment (5.4% versus 5.4%, P=1.0), and complication rate (0.7% versus 2.6%, P=0.3). Patients whose operation ended later in the day had a longer hospital stay. We observed a trend toward more SDDs, the further we got from the initiation of our protocol.<br />CONCLUSIONS: SDD is safe for children undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy for nonperforated appendicitis. The two main barriers to SDD were time of day for the operation and provider habit, both of which improved as more practitioners felt comfortable with the concept. SDD requires extensive education within the hospital system, and we have initiated an aggressive prospective protocol to improve the results.","24725679","2014","7"

"667","Quality check of a quality measure: surgical wound classification discrepancies impact risk-stratified surgical site infection rates in pediatric appendicitis.","Journal of the American College of Surgeons","BACKGROUND: The impact of quality measures in health care and reimbursement is growing. Ensuring the accuracy of quality measures, including any risk-stratification variables, is necessary. Surgical site infection rates, risk stratified by surgical wound classification (SWC) among other variables, are increasingly considered as quality measures. We hypothesized that hospital-documented and diagnosis-based SWCs are frequently discordant and that diagnosis-based SWCs better predict surgical site infection rates.<br />STUDY DESIGN: All pediatric patients (ie, younger than 18 years old) at a single institution who underwent an appendectomy for appendicitis between October 1, 2010 and August 31, 2011 were included. Each chart was reviewed to determine the hospital-documented SWC, which is recorded by the circulating nurse (options included clean, clean-contaminated, contaminated, and dirty); SWC based on the surgeons' postoperative diagnosis, including contaminated (ie, acute nonperforated, nongangrenous appendicitis), dirty (ie, gangrenous and perforated appendicitis), and 30-day postoperative surgical site infections.<br />RESULTS: Of the 312 evaluated appendicitis cases, the diagnosis-based and circulating nurse-based SWCs differed in 288 (92%) cases. The circulating nurse-based and diagnosis-based SWCs differed by more than one SWC in 176 (56%) cases. Surgical site infections were associated with worsening diagnosis-based SWC, but not with circulating nurse-based SWC.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Significant discordance exists between hospital documentation by the circulating nurse- and surgeon diagnosis-based SWCs. Inconsistency in risk-stratified quality measures can have a significant effect on outcomes measures, which can lead to misdirection of quality-improvement efforts, incorrect inter-hospital rating, reduced reimbursements, and public misperceptions about quality of care.","24041560","2013","12"

Ascites associated with acute LP has been rarely reported as the prominent feature of a SLE fare. We report a 39-year-old woman who developed massive, painful ascites as the presenting manifestation of a SLE fare. Diagnostic workup ruled out the possibility of hepatic, cardiovascular, infectious, or malignant diseases, and confirmed the presence of a SLE fare. The patient was treated with methyl prednisolone and hydroxychloroquine resulting in dramatic improvement of her condition. During ambulatory follow up, she has remained asymptomatic up to the moment of this writing.

"669","Duration of antibiotic treatment after appendicectomy for acute complicated appendicitis.","The British journal of surgery","BACKGROUND: Antibiotic treatment after appendicectomy for complicated appendicitis aims to reduce postoperative infections. However, available data on the duration of treatment are limited. This study compared the difference in infectious complications between two protocols, involving either 3 or 5â€‰days of postoperative antibiotic treatment.<br />METHODS: This was an observational cohort study of all adult patients who had an appendicectomy between January 2004 and December 2010 at either one of two hospitals in the same region. At location A, the protocol included 3â€‰days of postoperative antibiotic treatment, whereas at location B it specified 5â€‰days. The primary outcome was the development of postoperative infections as either superficial wound infection or deep intra-abdominal infections.<br />RESULTS: A total of 1143 patients with acute appendicitis underwent appendicectomy, of whom 267 (23.4 per cent) had complicated appendicitis. The duration of postoperative antibiotic treatment was 3â€‰days in 135 patients (50.6 per cent) and at least 5â€‰days in 123 (46.1 per cent). No difference was found between antibiotic treatment for 3 or 5â€‰days in terms of developing an intra-abdominal abscess (odds ratio (OR) 1.77, 95 per cent confidence interval 0.68 to 4.58; P = 0.242) or a wound infection (OR 2.74, 0.54 to 13.80; P = 0.223). In patients with complicated appendicitis, the laparoscopic approach was identified as a risk factor for developing an intra-abdominal abscess in univariable analysis (OR 2.46, 1.00 to 6.04; P = 0.049), but was not confirmed as an independent risk factor for this complication in multivariable analysis (OR 2.32, 0.75 to 7.14; P = 0.144).<br />CONCLUSION: After appendicectomy for complicated appendicitis, 3â€‰days of antibiotic treatment is equally effective as 5â€‰days in reducing postoperative infections.","24668341","2014","5"
"670","Participation in life situations by persons with systemic sclerosis.","Disability and rehabilitation","Abstract Purpose: To measure the frequency of participation in life situations. Methods: A sample of 83 persons with systemic sclerosis (SSc) completed questionnaires regarding the presence and severity of disease symptoms, disability [the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)], depression [the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)], and participation [the Adelaide Activities Profile (AAP)]. On the AAP, individuals rate the frequency of participation in four domains: domestic chores, household maintenance, service to others and social activities. Results: Participants were predominantly female, married, educated, white, and had diffuse SSc. Mean age was 53.7 years and mean disease duration was 9.9 years. On the AAP, participation was significantly more frequent for domestic chores than for household maintenance, service to others, and social activities. More fatigue (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05), disability (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), and fatigue (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) resulted in lower total AAP scores. More fatigue, pain, severe gastrointestinal symptoms, and depression related to lower household maintenance scores, while the presence of ulcers and more disability and depression were associated with lower domestic chores scores. Conclusions: Participation in life situations in persons with SSc is related to higher disability, depression, and severity of disease symptoms. Interventions to address the disability, depression and symptoms may increase participation. Implications for Rehabilitation People with systemic sclerosis (SSc) have restrictions in participation including domestic chores, household maintenance, service to others compared to a normative sample. For practitioners, these findings show the need to assess participation in addition to impairments and activity limitations in persons with SSc. The Adelaide Activities Profile could be used to measure participation. Our findings also suggest that interventions addressing fatigue, disability and depression, may improve participation.","25052100","2014","7"

The small intestine, especially the ileum, is the most common origin of these neoplasms. Most of them are well differentiated with slow growth. Rarely, they are less differentiated, growing fast with a poor prognosis. Since symptoms can be atypical, the diagnosis is often accidental. Typical symptoms of carcinoid syndrome occur in less than 10% of patients. The most useful laboratory marker is chromogranin A; 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid is helpful in the monitoring of carcinoid syndrome. Ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, colonoscopy, video capsule endoscopy, balloon enteroscopy and somatostatin receptors scintigraphy are used in the visualisation. A histological report is crucial for the proper diagnostics and therapy of NENs, and it has been extensively described. The treatment of choice is surgery, either radical or palliative. Somatostatin analogues are crucial in the pharmacological treatment of the hormonally active and non-active small intestine NENs and NENs of the appendix. Radioisotope therapy is possible in patients with a good expression of somatostatin receptors. Chemotherapy is not effective in general. Everolimus therapy can be applied in patients with generalised NENs of the small intestine in progression and where there has been a failure or an inability to use other treatment options. Finally, we make recommendations regarding the monitoring of patients with NENs of the small intestine and appendix.","24431119","2013",\N
"674","Mapping the natural variation in whole bone stiffness and strength across skeletal sites.","Bone","Traits of the skeletal system are coordinately adjusted to establish mechanical homeostasis in response to genetic and environmental factors. Prior work demonstrated that this 'complex adaptive' process is not perfect, revealing a two-fold difference in whole bone stiffness of the tibia across a population. Robustness (specifically, total cross-sectional area relative to length) varies widely across skeletal sites and between sexes. However, it is unknown whether the natural variation in whole bone stiffness and strength also varies across skeletal sites and between men and women. We tested the hypotheses that: 1) all major long bones of the appendicular skeleton demonstrate inherent, systemic constraints in the degree to which morphological and compositional traits can be adjusted for a given robustness; and 2) these traits covary in a predictable manner independent of body size and robustness. We assessed the functional relationships among robustness, cortical area (Ct.Ar), cortical tissue mineral density (Ct.TMD), and bone strength index (BSI) across the long bones of the upper and lower limbs of 115 adult men and women. All bones showed a significant (p<0.001) positive regression between BSI and robustness after adjusting for body size, with slender bones being 1.7-2.3 times less stiff and strong in men and 1.3-2.8 times less stiff and strong in women compared to robust bones. Our findings are the first to document the natural inter-individual variation in whole bone stiffness and strength that exist within populations and that is predictable based on skeletal robustness for all major long bones. Documenting and further understanding this natural variation in strength may be critical for differentially diagnosing and treating skeletal fragility.","24999223","2014","10"

"676","Single incision laparoscopic appendectomy with two port: a case of appendiceal mucocele.","The Indian journal of surgery","Laparoscopic appendectomy for the neoplasm of the appendix remains a controversial subject in the literature. The main concern regarding laparoscopic treatment for the neoplasm of the appendix is incomplete resection and rupture of the tumor into the peritoneal cavity. There is a slight increase in the rate of invasion of the surgical margins in laparoscopic interventions. However, the prognosis of the neoplasm of the appendix treated with laparoscopic appendectomy is not different from an open surgical technique. A series of cases have been reported in the literature concerning the success rate of single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy used in the treatment of acute appendicitis. In our clinic, two-port laparoscopic appendectomy through a single incision was successfully performed on a 45-year-old male patient diagnosed with an appendiceal mucocele.

In advanced stages bowel involvement is common. In symptomatic disease the adequate treatment requires complete resection of all residues. Indications of colorectal resection for endometriosis remain controversial because of the risk of major complications. The purpose of this study was to show the feasibility of planned complete laparoscopic management of symptomatic deep pelvic endometriosis with bowel involvement performing segmental colorectal resection in a center of excellence.<br />METHODS: Between 2007 and 2012 all patients treated for symptomatic colorectal endometriosis in our institution were included and retrospectively evaluated. Laparoscopic excision of all visible disease was planned. Data analysis included age, previous history of endometriosis, intraoperative findings, operative procedure and intra- and postoperative complications.<br />RESULTS: In this time period 35 patients with bowel infiltrating endometriosis were treated. Affected locations were the rectovaginal space in 31 patients (89 %), the rectum in 32 patients (91 %), the sigmoid colon in 10 patients (29 %), the coecum in 2 patients (5.7 %), the appendix in 3 patients (8.6 %) and the terminal ileum in 1 patient (2.9 %). In the majority of patients (85.7 %) the resection was achieved laparoscopically, in 3 patients a conversion to laparotomy was necessary and in 2 patients a primary laparotomia was performed. Complications occurred in 2 cases with anastomotic leakage in 1 patient (2.8 %) and a rectovaginal fistula in another patient.

"682","Poorly differentiated mesenteric carcinoma of unknown primary site detected by abscess formation: case report.","World journal of surgical oncology","BACKGROUND: Carcinoma of unknown primary site (CUP) is said to account for approximately 3 to 5% of all carcinomas. However, an isolated lesion in the abdominal cavity is rare, and there are no reports describing associated abscess formation.<br />CASE PRESENTATION: A 76-year-old woman had consulted a previous physician complaining of fever and right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed an abscess formation around the cecum. She was treated conservatively with antibiotics, but the symptoms relapsed and she consulted our hospital. Enhanced CT showed a persistent abscess, a tumorous lesion in the mesentery and right hydronephrosis. Because malignancy could not be ruled out, surgical treatment was selected. At laparotomy, encapsulated abscesses were found on the mesenteric side and outside of the ileocecal region. When we raised the ileocecal region, a tumor was found to be fixed to the right ureter, and there was leakage of white, solid tumor content. This tumor content was submitted to intraoperative frozen section diagnosis which revealed a carcinoma. Ileocecal resection with D3 lymph node dissection and retroperitoneal tumor resection was thus performed. There were no abnormal findings in the uterus and adnexa, nor any evidence of peritoneal dissemination. We regarded this case as an incomplete resection and chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin was administered. The patient has remained alive and disease-free for almost one year since the primary operation.<br />CONCLUSION: We described a case with mesenteric CUP discovered during surgery for an intra-abdominal abscess. It is necessary to pay attention to treatment-resistant intraperitoneal abscesses as they may accompany a tumor.","24397776","2014",\N
"683","Direct pelvic access percutaneous nephrolithotomy in management of ectopic kidney stone: a case report and literature review.","Renal failure","Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) is an effective procedure for the treatment of patients with large or complex stones. PNL is challenging in anomalous kidneys, certain patients, such as those with renal ectopia. It is unable to undergo PNL in conventional technique safely in these cases. We presented a case report of laparoscopic-assisted PNL via direct pelvic puncture in a pelvic kidney stone and discussed previous published literature. A 49-year-old man presented with right lower quadrant pain and hematuria. Intravenous pyelography and three-dimensional computerized tomography revealed an opaque 2.7â€‰Ã—â€‰1.7â€‰cm pelvis renalis stone in a right side ectopic pelvic kidney with grade III hydronephrosis. Laparoscopic-assisted tubeless PNL was performed to remove the calculus. Laparoscopic-assisted PNL as a minimally invasive therapy in ectopic kidney has many advantages. Our case showed that, in pelvic ectopic kidney with pelvic stones greater than 1.5â€‰cm in size, laparoscopic-assisted PNL via direct pelvis puncture is a safe and effective technique.","23991847","2013",\N

Clinicopathological features, classification, treatment and prognosis of AMN were investigated retrospectively.<br />RESULTS: There were 11 cases of MA with neoplastic epithelium and mucin being defined in lumen and mucosa but without invasive lesions, and no relapse or death was found. In 41 LAMN cases, mucin was found in submucosa, muscularis proparis, or serosa of appendix, no or only scant mucinous epithelium with low grade dysplasia presented in mucinous pools in most cases(39/41). Among 41 LAMN cases, 3 developed relapse or PMP-L, and no death was observed. In 7 PMP-L cases, low grade dysplastic mucinous epithelium in mucinous pools could be found easily in 3 cases and was very scanty in 4 cases, with 1 relapse and 1 death. Eleven invasive carcinomas were found, including 7 MAC cases and 4 PMP-H cases, with local high grade dysplastic epithelium at least. In these invasive lesions, 4 cases recurred and 3 case died(including 2 recurred cases above). MA and LAMN were both non-invasive neoplasms histologically, however, PMP-L, MAC and PMP-H were regarded as adenocarcinomas according to their biological behavior.<br />CONCLUSION: AMN displays a relatively homogeneous group of neoplasms that pursues a predictable clinical course based on their nature, so it is necessary to diagnose and administrative accurately with consistently standards for these neoplastic entities.","24519053","2014","1"
"687","The role of a colon resection in combination with a Malone appendicostomy as part of a bowel management program for the treatment of fecal incontinence.","Journal of pediatric surgery","PURPOSE: Surgical options previously described by us as part of a bowel management program for the treatment of soiling and fecal incontinence include (1) resection of a megarectosigmoid to reduce a patient's laxative requirement or (2) a Malone appendicostomy in patients who require enemas. We have found that some patients may benefit from both procedures.<br />METHODS: We reviewed 18 fecally incontinent patients with structural or functional disorders of the anorectosigmoid (16 ARM, 1 spina bifida, and 1 SCT) who underwent both procedures.<br />RESULTS: Of 18 patients, the enema regimen prior to resection had an average volume of 681 ml of saline (Range 400-1000 ml) and 60 ml (Range 48-117 ml) of additives (glycerine, castile soap and/or phosphate). Following the colon resection, the average volume of saline and additives was 335 ml (Range 130-650 ml) and 25 ml (Range 0-60 ml), respectively, a 50% reduction for both (P<0.01). The time for enema administration and evacuation was reduced by 25%, and the enemas were more effective, rendering the patients clean in 18 of 18 cases (follow-up was 3 months to 21 years). 2 patients later demonstrated that they could be managed with laxatives alone.<br />CONCLUSION: In patients with poor continence potential and a megarectosigmoid, combining a colon resection with a Malone appendicostomy can make the enema more effective. In some rare cases we found the resection may allow for a better response to laxatives.","24210202","2013","11"
"688","Wound classification in pediatric general surgery: significant variation exists among providers.","Journal of the American College of Surgeons","BACKGROUND: Risk-adjusted rates of surgical site infections (SSI) are used as a quality metric to facilitate improvement within a hospital system and allow comparison across institutions. The NSQIP-Pediatric, among others, uses surgical wound classification as a variable in models designed to predict risk-adjusted postoperative morbidity, including SSI rates. The purpose of this study was to measure the level of agreement in wound classification assignment among 3 providers: surgeons, operating room (OR) nurses, and NSQIP surgical clinical reviewers (SCR).<br />STUDY DESIGN: An analysis was performed of pediatric general surgery operations from 2010 to 2011. Wound classification was assigned at the time of operation by the OR nurse and surgeon, and by the NSQIP SCR postoperatively, according to NSQIP methodology. Disagreement was defined as any discrepancy in classification among the 3 providers, and the level of agreement was determined using the kappa statistic.<br />RESULTS: For the 374 procedures reviewed, there was an overall disagreement of 48% among all providers, kappa 0.48 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.53). When comparing wound classification by surgeon and NSQIP SCR, 23% of cases were in disagreement, kappa 0.74 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.78). Disagreement between OR nurse and either surgeon or NSQIP SCR was higher: 38%, kappa 0.45 (95% CI 0.38 to 0.53) and 40%, kappa 0.44 (95% CI 0.37 to 0.51). Fundoplication, appendectomy, and cholecystectomy demonstrated the highest overall disagreement (73%, 71%, and 60%, respectively).<br />CONCLUSIONS: There is significant variation in assigning surgical wound classification among health care providers. For future SSI comparative analyses, it will be critical to improve uniformity and understanding of wound class assignment among providers and institutions.","24012296","2013","11"
"689","Practice Patterns and Guideline Adherence in the Management of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.","Clinical pediatrics","Background. Current data are limited on compliance with guidelines for the treatment of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Methods. A survey assessing compliance with ADHD guidelines for diagnosis and management was distributed to pediatricians in a practice research network. Comparisons were made by practitioner characteristics. Results. In all, 42/76 surveys were returned (55%). Respondents largely adhered to American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines. A lower percentage reported compliance for rescreening with a standardized tool (80%), use of electrocardiograms (78% rarely use), and the use of routine additional testing (80% rarely use). Academic practitioners were more likely to rescreen (100% vs 79%, P < .05). Private practitioners more often used newer therapeutic agents (7% vs 44%, P < .01). Older graduates were more comfortable diagnosing at a young age (93% vs 56%, P < .01) and were more comfortable using sleep agents (60% vs 15%, P < .01). Conclusion. Pediatricians largely adhered to AAP guidelines. These findings support changes made to the guidelines in 2011.

Men (n = 1,411) and women (n = 960) aged 20-93 years, enrolled in the Geelong Osteoporosis Study, were randomly selected from the Barwon Statistical Division using the electoral roll as a sampling frame in 2001-2006 (67 % participation) and 1993-1997 (77 % participation), respectively. Using DXA (Lunar DPX-L or Prodigy Pro) at baseline for men and at the 10-year follow-up for women (2004-2008), total and appendicular lean mass were measured. Means and standard deviations for each lean mass measure (absolute and relative to height squared) were generated for each age decade, and cutpoints equivalent to T scores of -2.0 and -1.0 were calculated using data from young adult men and women aged 20-39 years. Young adult reference data were derived from 374 men and 308 women. Cutpoints for relative appendicular lean mass equal to T scores of -2.0 and -1.0 were 6.94 and 7.87 kg/m(2) for men and 5.30 and 6.07 kg/m(2) for women. The proportions of men and women aged â‰¥80 years with a T score less than -2.0 were 16.0 and 6.2 %, respectively.

Eighty-one middle-aged and older adults (41 men and 40 women) aged 50 to 74 years volunteered for the study. Approximately two thirds of the subjects (34 men and 17 women) carried out regular sports activity (at least >2 times a week) including running and cycling exercise. MTH was measured using B-mode ultrasound at two sites on the anterior (A50) and posterior (P50) aspects of the mid-thigh. A50:P50 MTH ratio was calculated to evaluate site-specific thigh muscle loss. aLM and percent body fat were also determined using a DXA. Men had lower body fat and higher aLM than women. Anterior and posterior thigh MTH as well as A50:P50 MTH ratio was higher in men than in women. Zigzag walking time was faster in men than in women. Anterior and posterior thigh MTH was positively (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) correlated to aLM and aLM index in men and women. However, A50:P50 MTH ratio was not significantly correlated with aLM and aLM index in both sexes. There was no significant correlation between aLM index and zigzag walking time in men and women. A50:P50 MTH ratio was inversely (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) correlated to zigzag walking time in both men and women. Our results suggest that thigh MTH ratio is independent of age-related muscle mass loss detected by aLM.","24569919","2014","6"

Ten patients (7.7%) were left with a short bowel due to anatomical and surgical reasons. All these patients were subjected to ileostomy. Four patients (40%) were treated for ovarian carcinoma, 4 (40%) for colon and appendiceal carcinoma, 1 for peritoneal mesothelioma and 1 patient for primary peritoneal carcinoma. The completeness of cytoreduction (CC) score was CC-0 in 4 patients (40%), CC-1 in 3 (30%) and CC-2 in 3 (30%).<br />RESULTS: The mean length of the remaining small bowel was 105 cm (range 80-150). Mean hospitalization was 42 days vs 24 days in other patients with CRS+HIPEC (p<0.002). The daily ileostomy output increased between the 3rd to 4th week as a result of oral feeding and decreased at the 4th week due to somatostatin analogue administration and possible intestinal adaptation. The mean ileostomy output at 6 months was 810Â±100 ml vs 1590Â±210 ml the first month after CRS+HIPEC (p<0.001). The overall morbidity and mortality rate was the same as in patients without extensive resection. The impact of small bowel syndrome (SBS) on overall survival was very important, as the mean overall survival in the SBS group was 28.6 months vs 41 months in other CRS+HIPEC patients (p<0.001).<br />CONCLUSIONS: SBS is sometimes inevitable in order to perform optimal cytoreduction. Special management is required for these patients, including special nutritional efforts and home total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Extensive small bowel resection may constitute a contraindication in the management of peritoneal carcinomatosis.","24965420",\N,\N

The patient was a 49-year-old man who presented with acute right-sided abdominal pain. There were no masses palpable on physical examination. Radiographic findings showed large multi-nodular tumors mainly in the right lobe of the liver. Fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scan showed uptake only in the liver, and no uptake in the testes. We initially planned to perform a liver resection for the presumed diagnosis of intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma. However, the tumors grew rapidly and ruptured. Multiple lung metastases rapidly developed resulting in respiratory failure, preventing liver resection or even biopsy. He died 60 d after initial presentation with no pathological diagnosis. Postmortem studies included histopathological and immunohistological examinations which diagnosed a primary choriocarcinoma of the liver. Primary hepatic choriocarcinoma is very rare but should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a liver tumor in a middle aged man. Establishing this diagnosis may enable treatment of the choriocarcinoma. Liver biopsy and evaluation of serum human chorionic gonadotropin are recommended in these patients.","24409080","2013","12"

Alterations in T-cell populations, especially regulatory T cells (Tregs), are often evident in patients suffering from these diseases. To be able to detect changes in T-cell populations in diseased tissue, it is crucial to investigate T-cell populations in healthy individuals, and to characterize their variation among different regions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. While limited data exist, quantitative data on biopsies systematically drawn from various regions of the GI tract are lacking, particularly in healthy young humans. In this report, we present the first systematic assessment of how T cells--including Tregs--are distributed in the gastrointestinal mucosa throughout the GI tract of healthy young humans by means of multi-parameter FACS analysis. Gastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were performed on 16 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 32. Biopsies were drawn from seven GI regions, and were used to determine the frequencies of CD8(+)-, CD4(+)- and Tregs in the gastrointestinal mucosa by means of multi-parameter FACS analysis. Our data show that there is significant variation in the baseline T-cell landscape along the healthy human gastrointestinal tract, and that mucosal T-cell analyses from a single region should not be taken as representative of the entire gastrointestinal tract. We show that certain T-cell subsets in the gastrointestinal mucosa vary significantly among regions; most notably, that Tregs are enriched in the appendiceal orifice region and the ascending colon, and that CD8(pos) T cells are enriched in the gastric mucosa.","24265815","2013",\N

Poorly differentiated or undifferentiated MC with an unusual histological appearance and immunoprofile in addition to heavy lymphoid infiltrate could make it problematic when differentiating it from a high grade lymphoma, in particular anaplastic large B- or T-cell lymphoma, plasmablastic lymphoma, and other undifferentiated neoplasms. Here we reported a unique case of an 81 y/o woman presenting with a 7.0 cm colon mass detected by computed tomography (CT) scan. A partial transverse and ileum resection with appendectomy were performed. Microscopic examination revealed sheets of large, pleomorphic, mitotically-active cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and multiple prominent nucleoli, growing with a pushing border and poor glandular formation in a background of intratumoral lymphocytes. The neoplastic cells were only focally positive for keratins (<10%); diffusely and strongly positive for vimentin and CD10 with high proliferative index (Ki-67, 90%). The tumor cells were also aberrantly positive for CD30, CD79a and CD43 (diffusely or focally), resulting in a diagnostic dilemma between colonic MC and high grade lymphoma. Careful examination and additional immunohistochemical stains performed proved there was no evidence of T or B-cell lymphoma, melanoma, or other types of primary colon or metastatic carcinomas. This case highlights the difficulty in distinguishing a high grade lymphoma and poorly differentiated colonic MC, and, also the aberrant expression of CD10 and a significant loss of pancytokeratin could result in a diagnostic pitfall.","24551312","2014",\N

Therefore, we examine the time course and reversibility of changes in the distribution of immunoreactivity for substance P (SP), a marker of the central terminals of DRG neurons, in the spinal cord during and following dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. Acute and chronic treatment with DSS significantly increased SP immunoreactivity in thoracic and lumbosacral spinal cord segments. This increase developed over several weeks and was evident in both the superficial laminae of the dorsal horn and in lamina X. These increases persisted for 5 weeks following cessation of both the acute and chronic models. The increase in SP immunoreactivity was not observed in segments of the cervical spinal cord, which were not innervated by the axons of colonic afferent neurons. DRG neurons dissociated following acute DSS-colitis exhibited increased neurite sprouting compared with neurons dissociated from control mice. These data suggest significant colitis-induced enhancements in neuropeptide expression in DRG neuron central terminals. Such neurotransmitter plasticity persists beyond the period of active inflammation and might contribute to a sustained increase in nociceptive signaling following the resolution of inflammation.","24715114","2014","5"

While patients with cerebral palsy presented with significantly greater motor disability than the DYT1 cohort at baseline, both groups demonstrated improvement at 1 year (cerebral palsy = 24%; DYT1 = 6%). The group as a whole demonstrated significant improvement on the Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale across time. Gains in motor function were apparent in both axial and appendicular distributions involving both upper and lower extremities. Gains achieved by 6 months were sustained in the cerebral palsy group, whereas the DYT1 group demonstrated continued improvement with ongoing pallidal stimulation beyond 18 months. Young patients with dystonia due to cerebral palsy responded comparably to patients with DYT1 dystonia. The severity of motor impairment in patients with cerebral palsy at baseline and follow-up raises the issue of even earlier intervention with neuromodulation in this population to limit long-term motor impairments due to dystonia.","23666041","2013","7"
"709","Prefrontal control and internet addiction: a theoretical model and review of neuropsychological and neuroimaging findings.","Frontiers in human neuroscience","Most people use the Internet as a functional tool to perform their personal goals in everyday-life such as making airline or hotel reservations. However, some individuals suffer from a loss of control over their Internet use resulting in personal distress, symptoms of psychological dependence, and diverse negative consequences. This phenomenon is often referred to as Internet addiction. Only Internet Gaming Disorder has been included in the appendix of the DSM-5, but it has already been argued that Internet addiction could also comprise problematic use of other applications with cybersex, online relations, shopping, and information search being Internet facets at risk for developing an addictive behavior. Neuropsychological investigations have pointed out that certain prefrontal functions in particular executive control functions are related to symptoms of Internet addiction, which is in line with recent theoretical models on the development and maintenance of the addictive use of the Internet. Control processes are particularly reduced when individuals with Internet addiction are confronted with Internet-related cues representing their first choice use. For example, processing Internet-related cues interferes with working memory performance and decision making. Consistent with this, results from functional neuroimaging and other neuropsychological studies demonstrate that cue-reactivity, craving, and decision making are important concepts for understanding Internet addiction. The findings on reductions in executive control are consistent with other behavioral addictions, such as pathological gambling. They also emphasize the classification of the phenomenon as an addiction, because there are also several similarities with findings in substance dependency. The neuropsychological and neuroimaging results have important clinical impact, as one therapy goal should enhance control over the Internet use by modifying specific cognitions and Internet use expectancies.","24904393","2014",\N

"712","The acute surgical unit model verses the traditional \"on call\" model: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","World journal of surgery","BACKGROUND: The acute surgical unit (ASU) is a novel model for the provision of emergency general surgery care. The ASU model was initially developed in New South Wales hospitals during 2005 and 2006. Several studies have analysed the effects on patient outcomes and timeliness of care for nontrauma patients presenting with acute general surgical conditions. The purpose of this study was to perform a meta-analysis to determine the efficacy of the ASU model compared with the traditional on-call model for specific conditions.<br />METHODS: A systematic search was conducted using MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Current Contents Connect, Cochrane library, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Web of Science. Original data were extracted from each study and used to calculate a pooled odd ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI).<br />RESULTS: The search identified 18 studies; appendectomy (n = 9), acute cholecystitis (n = 7), and small-bowel obstruction (SBO) (n = 2). In the appendectomy cohort, the proportion of appendicular perforation were similar in pre-ASU and ASU period (OR 1.02, 95 % CI 0.77-1.37, p = 0.13). The incidence of complications in the appendectomy cohort was significantly lower in the ASU group; 14.5 % pre-ASU and 10.9 % post-ASU (OR 1.649, 95 % CI 0.732-3.714, p = 0.009). The negative appendectomy rate was similar for the pre- and post-ASU groups (OR 1.07, 95 % CI 0.88-1.31, p = 0.83). Likewise the conversion rate to open surgery and total hospital stay were similar between the two groups. The proportion of night time operations reduced significantly in the ASU period (OR 1.9, 95 % CI 1.32-2.74, p = 0.001). In the acute cholecystitis cohort, the conversion rate to open surgery was significantly higher in the pre-ASU group (15.1 %) compared with the post-ASU group (7.5 %) (OR 1.879, 95 % CI 1.072-3.293, p = 0.04) The incidence of complications was higher in the pre-ASU (14 %) compared with the post-ASU (6.8 %) group (OR 2.231, 95 % CI 1.372-3.236, p = 0.03). The mean hospital stay was significantly lower in the ASU period (5.3 vs. 3.7 days, p = 0.0063). There was insufficient data available to analyse outcomes for SBO.<br />CONCLUSIONS: The ASU model provides a safe surgical environment for patients and is associated with a reduced complication rate for appendectomy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. There is a reduced conversion rate and a shorter length of stay for patients with acute cholecystitis. Overall, the ASU model has translated to better outcomes for patients presenting with acute general surgical conditions.","24430507","2014","6"
"713","Sedentary behaviour and adiposity in elite athletes.","Journal of sports sciences","Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a health risk. Even in athletes an increased adiposity affects health and performance. Sedentary behaviour has been associated with higher levels of adiposity, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. However, it is unclear whether this independent relationship still exists in highly trained athletes. The aim of this study was to examine the association of sedentary behaviour with body fatness in elite athletes. Cross-sectional data from 82 male athletes (mean age 22 years) were used. Total and regional body composition was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Self-reported time spent in sedentary behaviour and weekly training time was assessed in all participants at one time point and multiple regression analyses were used. Sedentary behaviour predicted total fat mass (Î² = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.36-1.19, P < 0.001) and trunk fat mass (Î² = 0.25; 95% CI: 0.07-0.43, P = 0.007), independent of age, weekly training time, and residual mass (calculated as weight-dependent variable) but not abdominal fat. Also, no associations of sedentary behaviour with fat-free mass, appendicular lean soft tissue, and body mass index were found. These findings indicate that athletes with higher amounts of sedentary behaviour presented higher levels of total and trunk fatness, regardless of age, weekly training time, and residual mass. Therefore, even high moderate-to-vigorous physical activity levels do not mitigate the associations between sedentary behaviour and body fatness in highly trained athletes.","24915288","2014",\N

"721","Ovarian artery aneurysm after postpartum hemorrhage: a case report.","Obstetrics and gynecology","INTRODUCTION: Ovarian artery aneurysm rupture can be a life-threatening event and although rare, with less than 25 cases present in the English literature, it is an important pathological process. As a result of the asymptomatic nature of most ovarian artery aneurysms, the condition is likely underdiagnosed and thus risk factors for rupture likely understudied. Various theories regarding ovarian artery aneurysm development exist. In addition to plausible perspectives relating to the physiologic changes of pregnancy, hypertension is also a well-recognized risk factor for aneurysm development in humans and that elevated blood pressure affects many pregnant and nonpregnant individuals today.<br />METHODS: We present the case of a 25-year-old multiparous woman with gestational hypertension who presented on postpartum day 6 after a spontaneous vaginal delivery with abdominal pain localized to the right lower quadrant. This delivery was complicated by postpartum hemorrhage ultimately controlled with a bimanual massage and misoprostol. Computed tomography of her abdomen and pelvis revealed a large right retroperitoneal hematoma, which, on angiography, was discovered to have resulted from a ruptured ovarian artery aneurysm.<br />CONCLUSION: We acknowledge the possibility of including hypertension as a risk factor for ovarian artery aneurysm development as well as vigorous uterine massage as a possible supporting historical finding in consideration of aneurysm rupture in this scenario. Given these considerations, maintaining a high index of suspicion for this condition in the postpartum patient given may lead to earlier diagnosis and life-saving treatment as well as to an improved understanding of ovarian artery aneurysm formation and rupture.","24770094","2014","5"

The present study examined the influence of hydrodynamic and biological variables driven by monsoon system on the siphonophore assemblages through an annual cycle in 2004. Calycophorans, namely Chelophyes appendiculata, Diphyes chamissonis, Lensia subtiloides, Bassia bassensis, and Muggiaea atlantica, were the most dominant siphonophore species. Maximum abundance of these dominant species generally occurred during the warm period (May and August), while M. atlantica had a significantly peak abundance in February. Although no apparently temporal difference in siphonophore abundance was observed in the study, siphonophore assemblage was more diverse in August than in other sampling times. Result of a cluster analysis indicated that assemblage structure of siphonophores in the waters around Taiwan varied at temporal and spatial scales during the sampling period. The intrusions of the Kuroshio Branch Current and China Coastal Current to the study area play an important role on the transportation of siphonophores. Also, the distribution of siphonophore assemblage was closely related to the hydrographic characteristics, with temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, and zooplankton abundance being the major environmental factors affecting the spatio-temporal variability of siphonophores. This study contributes substantially to the new knowledge of the siphonophore assemblage in the tropical-temperate waters of Taiwan.","24932727","2014",\N

We aimed to assess the association between the CD4:CD8 ratio and markers of age-associated disease in treated HIV-infected patients with good immunovirological response.<br />METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted in 132 HIV-infected adults on antiretroviral therapy (ART), with plasma HIV RNA < 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL for at least 1 year, CD4 count > 350 cells/Î¼L and age < 65 years. We analysed the associations between the CD4:CD8 ratio and subclinical atherosclerosis [assessed using carotid intima-media thickness (IMT)], arterial stiffness [assessed using the augmentation index (AIx)], the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), muscle wasting and sarcopenia [assessed using appendicular lean mass/height(2) (ALM) measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)].<br />RESULTS: CD4:CD8 ratio inversion was associated with higher IMT, lower eGFR and lower ALM (all values P < 0.05), but not with AIx. In multivariate analyses adjusted for age, sex, hypertriglyceridaemia, tobacco use and cumulative ART exposure, inversion of the CD4:CD8 ratio was independently associated with higher IMT [odds ratio (OR) 2.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-7.1], arterial stiffness (OR 4.8; 95% CI 1.0-23.5) and lower eGFR (OR 5.2; 95% CI 1.0-64.4), but not sarcopenia (OR 0.7; 95% CI 0.2-2.7).

"728","Hyper-IgD and periodic fever syndrome: a new MVK mutation (p.R277G) associated with a severe phenotype.","Gene","Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D and periodic fever syndrome (HIDS; MIM# 260920) is a rare recessively-inherited autoinflammatory condition caused by mutations in the MVK gene, which encodes for mevalonate kinase, an essential enzyme in the isoprenoid pathway. HIDS is clinically characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and inflammation. Here we report on the case of a 2 year-old Portuguese boy with recurrent episodes of fever, malaise, massive cervical lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly since the age of 12 months. Rash, arthralgia, abdominal pain and diarrhea were also seen occasionally. During attacks a vigorous acute-phase response was detected, including elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A and leukocytosis. Clinical and laboratory improvement was seen between attacks. Despite normal serum IgD level, HIDS was clinically suspected. Mutational MVK analysis revealed the homozygous genotype with the novel p.Arg277Gly (p.R277G) mutation, while the healthy non-consanguineous parents were heterozygous.

"729","Yersinia pseudotuberculosis enterocolitis mimicking enteropathic Î³Î´ T-cell lymphoma with abnormal clonality.","BMC infectious diseases","BACKGROUND: Yersinia pseudotuberculosis generally infects the gastrointestinal tract and causes enteropathy symptoms suggesting infection. Y. pseudotuberculosis infections are often complicated with intraceliac lymphoadenopathy mimicking malignant lymphoma. This is a first case of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis enteropathy mimicking enteropathic Î³Î´ T-cell lymphoma. This case highlighted the Î³Î´ T-cell reaction to Yersinia enterocolitis sometimes mimicking malignant lymphoma clinically.<br />CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old female was referred to our institute due to abdominal pain with skin rush, fever and diarrhea. Computed tomography (CT) scanning revealed mucosal swelling of the cecum with enlargement of regional lymph nodes. Laboratory data showed elevated CRP (7.74 mg/dL), an increased level of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R 3095 IU/mL), and CD3+ Î³Î´ T-cell circulation in peripheral blood and bone marrow (10.9% and 3.9%, respectively). Increased proportions of Î³Î´ T-cells supported the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma. Colonoscopy demonstrated hemorrhagic mucosal erosion with partial ulceration, and the subsequent pathological findings at the inflammation site suggested malignant lymphoma histopathology in the colon. These objective findings were entirely consistent with enteropathic Î³Î´ T-cell lymphoma. Thereafter, however, the microbiological results of the patient's stool at admission showed Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and she was diagnosed as having Yersinia enterocolitis. All abnormal findings including subjective symptoms were in remission or mitigated within 2 weeks after her onset. Even the Î³Î´ T-cell circulation disappeared (0.04% in peripheral blood), and we speculate that those cells were a reaction to the Yersinia infection.<br />CONCLUSION: In this case, a differential diagnosis included infectious enterocolitis from other immunogenic or malignant diseases. Although a measurement of sIL-2R is critical in differentiating malignant lymphoma in patients suffering with lymph adenopathy, that is not confirmative. This patient's case indicates that T cells expressing the Î³Î´ T-cell receptor might be associated with the acute and late phase reactions, in which T cells play a role in the construction of granulomas and the establishment of sequelae.","24468017","2014",\N

Postoperative paralytic ileus can commonly complicate scoliosis surgery. Ogilvie's syndrome as a cause of abdominal distension and pain has not been reported following spinal deformity correction and can mimic post-surgical ileus. 12 year old female patient with double thoracic and lumbar scoliosis associated with Arnold-Chiari 1 malformation and syringomyelia. The patient underwent posterior spinal fusion from T4 to L3 with segmental pedicle screw instrumentation and autogenous iliac crest grafting. She developed abdominal distension and pain postoperatively and this deteriorated despite conservative management. Repeat ultrasounds and abdominal computer tomography scans ruled out mechanical obstruction. The clinical presentation and blood parameters excluded toxic megacolon and cecal volvulus. As the symptoms persisted, a laparotomy was performed on postoperative day 16, which demonstrated ragged tears of the colon and cecum. A right hemi-colectomy followed by ileocecal anastomosis was required. The pathological examination of surgical specimens excluded inflammatory bowel disease and vascular abnormalities. The patient made a good recovery following bowel surgery and at latest followup 3.2 years later she had no abdominal complaints and an excellent scoliosis correction. Ogilvie's syndrome should be included in the differential diagnosis of postoperative ileus in patients developing prolonged unexplained abdominal distension and pain after scoliosis correction. Early diagnosis and instigation of conservative management can prevent major morbidity and mortality due to bowel ischemia and perforation.","23960287","2013","7"
"731","Asynchronous vs didactic education: it's too early to throw in the towel on tradition.","BMC medical education","BACKGROUND: Asynchronous, computer based instruction is cost effective, allows self-directed pacing and review, and addresses preferences of millennial learners. Current research suggests there is no significant difference in learning compared to traditional classroom instruction. Data are limited for novice learners in emergency medicine. The objective of this study was to compare asynchronous, computer-based instruction with traditional didactics for senior medical students during a week-long intensive course in acute care. We hypothesized both modalities would be equivalent.<br />METHODS: This was a prospective observational quasi-experimental study of 4th year medical students who were novice learners with minimal prior exposure to curricular elements. We assessed baseline knowledge with an objective pre-test. The curriculum was delivered in either traditional lecture format (shock, acute abdomen, dyspnea, field trauma) or via asynchronous, computer-based modules (chest pain, EKG interpretation, pain management, trauma). An interactive review covering all topics was followed by a post-test. Knowledge retention was measured after 10Â weeks. Pre and post-test items were written by a panel of medical educators and validated with a reference group of learners. Mean scores were analyzed using dependent t-test and attitudes were assessed by a 5-point Likert scale.<br />RESULTS: 44 of 48 students completed the protocol. Students initially acquired more knowledge from didactic education as demonstrated by mean gain scores (didactic: 28.39% Â± 18.06; asynchronous 9.93% Â± 23.22). Mean difference between didactic and asynchronousâ€‰=â€‰18.45% with 95% CI [10.40 to 26.50]; pâ€‰=â€‰0.0001. Retention testing demonstrated similar knowledge attrition: mean gain scores -14.94% (didactic); -17.61% (asynchronous), which was not significantly different: 2.68% Â± 20.85, 95% CI [-3.66 to 9.02], pâ€‰=â€‰0.399. The attitudinal survey revealed that 60.4% of students believed the asynchronous modules were educational and 95.8% enjoyed the flexibility of the method. 39.6% of students preferred asynchronous education for required didactics; 37.5% were neutral; 23% preferred traditional lectures.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Asynchronous, computer-based instruction was not equivalent to traditional didactics for novice learners of acute care topics. Interactive, standard didactic education was valuable. Retention rates were similar between instructional methods. Students had mixed attitudes toward asynchronous learning but enjoyed the flexibility. We urge caution in trading in traditional didactic lectures in favor of asynchronous education for novice learners in acute care.","23927420","2013",\N

A corresponding regulation of the German Ministry of Health states that the quantification of the degree of additional benefit should be made in the terms \"major additional benefit\", \"considerable additional benefit\" and \"little additional benefit\". In September 2011 the IQWiG undertook and explained in appendix A of the dossier evaluation of Ticagrelor an \"operationalisation of the extent of additional benefit according to AM-NutzenV\". Therein a distinction was made between the target categories \"survival time (mortality)\", \"serious (or, respectively, severe) symptoms\", \"quality of life\", and \"not serious (or, respectively, not severe) symptoms\". In the operationalisation of the IQWiG, the categorisation of the additional benefit with regard to mortality was addressed by definition of threshold values for the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the relative risk (RR). The statutory regulations and the operationalisation of the IQWiG will have direct long-term effects on the provision of medical care since they have a say as to which drugs are to be available at which prices. By introduction of terms such as \"major additional benefit\", \"considerable additional benefit\" or \"desired effects\" and linking them to statistical parameters and algorithms, they also open a series of further fundamental questions as to if and how we should handle these terms in the future and what consequences are inherent to the use of statistical criteria in their \"definition\". In the present article 6 of the questions that arise in this context are discussed: Can a \"considerable additional benefit\" be defined with statistical methods? Can a classification of the additional benefit on the basis of an estimated RR be reliable? What are the fundamental possibilities of a \"statistical\" operationalisation? Is there a unique relative risk for the endpoint mortality? Is a relative risk a reasonable measure for the additional benefit? Should studies be planned in future in such a way that a \"true\" considerable effect can be demonstrated? My presentation is intended to make it clear that even the use of mathematical/statistical methods for the quantification or classification of an additional benefit cannot provide a perfect solution to the underlying problem of decisions made under uncertainty. Furthermore, they point to fundamental ques-tions arising in the process of quantification. For example, should absolute or relative changes in mortality be decisive for price fixing and what time horizon should be chosen to evaluate the mortality of a treatment? With regard to the planning of new studies the question arises as to whether or not they should (or may) be powered towards the detection of any benefit at all or of a considerable additional benefit.","24554518","2014","11"

MÃ¼llerian malformations result from defective fusion of the MÃ¼llerian ducts during development of the female reproductive system. These malformations are associated with an increased probability of adverse obstetric events. The syndrome is characterized by uterus didelphys with obstructed hemivagina, and ipsilateral renal agenesis. Patients with this syndrome are asymptomatic until menarche, and can follow other complications.<br />CASE REPORT: A 12 year-old female patient presented with a clinical picture of acute abdomen and a previous history of cyclical dysmenorrhea. A diagnosis of uterus didelphys associated with right hematometracolpos was made following an exploratory laparotomy. Resection of the right obstructed hemivagina was subsequently performed using a vaginal approach. A subsequent computed tomography seen identified renal agenesis ipsilateral to the obstructed hemivagina.<br />IN CONCLUSION: The Herlyn-Werner-WÃ¼nderlich syndrome is a rare MÃ¼llerian anomaly. The characteristics of the syndrome may result in missed diagnosis until detailed evaluation is carried out. We therefore advise clinicians to look for MÃ¼llerian duct anomalies whenever a renal malformation is discovered in a fetus or girl postnatal. Early diagnosis of the syndrome and its associated anomalies are essential to provide adequate therapy, and to reduce reproductive complications through radical treatments. Conservative treatment is effective and has a good prognosis for the patient's reproductive function.","24483046","2013","10"

The lactate levels were measured in the serum and peritoneal fluid. In total, 31 of 88 patients required reintervention. The receiver operator characteristic analysis was used to determine the best threshold value for the peritoneal-serum lactate ratio and for peritoneal lactate levels applied alone to identify patients who required reintervention.<br />RESULTS: A peritoneal-serum lactate ratio greater than 4.5 (area under the curve, 0.865; 95% confidence interval, 0.773-0.957; p < 0.001) and a peritoneal lactate value greater than 9.1 mmol/L (area under the curve, 0.834; 95% confidence interval, 0.735-0.934; p < 0.0001) discriminated between patients who required reintervention with a sensitivity of 91.3%, a specificity of 81%, and a negative predictive value of 94.4% and a sensitivity of 81.9%, a specificity of 82%, and a positive predictive value of 89%, respectively.<br />CONCLUSION: The results of our study support the hypothesis that the peritoneal-serum lactate ratio and the peritoneal lactate level applied alone could be safe, simple, inexpensive, noninvasive, and potentially valuable tools for the early identification of patients who require reintervention after elective or emergency abdominal surgery.<br />LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic study, level III.

The authors describe a patient with previously diagnosed hemihypertrophy of the trunk who had a history of large thoracic lipomas resected during infancy, a thoracic hump due to adipose proliferation within the thoracic paraspinal musculature, and scoliotic deformity. She had fatty infiltration in the thoracic spinal nerves on MRI, identical to findings pathognomonic of LN at better-known sites. Enlargement of the transverse processes at those levels and thickened ribs were also found.

We limited our study of wound classifications to appendectomies and posed the question whether different reviewers classify individual cases differently.<br />METHODS: We evaluated the wound classifications of 105 consecutive appendectomies in our community hospital. Four reviewers graded retrospectively the wound classifications, first after reading the description of the appendix in the operative report and again after reading the pathology report. The wound classifications of the four reviewers were evaluated for concordance with the original operating room nurse (ORN) assignment.<br />RESULTS: The kappa scores for inter-observer concordance of wound classifications among the four reviewers based on their interpretation of the operative report and the ORN who originally classified the operation ranged from 0.1028 to 0.1597. By conventional standards, this represents no better than \"slight agreement\" for any of the reviewers. We found that 19%, 50%, 94%, 95%, or 96% of our appendectomies would be considered \"high risk,\" Class 3 or 4, operations depending on which rater classified the operation. The additional information contained in the pathology reports did not change the distribution of wound classifications of the four reviewers significantly.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated considerable differences in the distribution of wound classifications of appendectomies among our ORNs and retrospective reviewers. A review of the surgical literature supports our finding that the incision classification system utilized commonly lacks precision, at least in the rating of appendectomies. We recommend that further studies be performed to determine whether changes in the definitions of wound classes are warranted.","23991652","2013","10"

In this study, we investigated the expression of MMPs and TIMPs messenger RNA and protein levels in apical periodontitis lesions.<br />METHODS: Tissue samples from patients presenting clinical signs of chronic apical abscess (CAA) or asymptomatic apical periodontitis (AAP) were collected postoperatively and used for gene expression analysis of MMP-2, -3, -7, -9, -14, -16, and -25; TIMP-1; and TIMP-2 in real-time polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemistry was also performed to detect the expression of MMP-7 and TIMP-1 proteins. Lastly, U-937 cells were induced to terminal differentiation into macrophages, infected with purified Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, and assessed for the expression of MMP-7 and TIMP-1 using immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy.<br />RESULTS: Significantly higher messenger RNA levels were found for all genes in AAP and CAA samples when compared with healthy control samples (P < .001). AAP cases exhibited significantly higher TIMP-1 when compared with CAA cases, whereas CAA cases showed higher MMP-2, MMP-7, and MMP-9 messenger RNA levels (P < .05). We also detected positive the expression of MMP-7 and TIMP-1 proteins in the tissue samples. The expression of both MMP-7 and TIMP-1 were increased in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cells compared with nonstimulated cells and appear to colocalize in the Golgi apparatus.<br />CONCLUSIONS: MMPs appear to have an influential role in CAA cases in which ongoing tissue destruction is observed. TIMPs are preferentially associated with AAP, perhaps as a subsequent defense mechanism against excessive destruction. Taken together, our findings implicate MMP and TIMP molecules in the dynamics of inflammatory periapical lesion development.","23953287","2013","9"

Bladder dysfunction is thought to have an important role in the etiology of this renal deterioration. We report the outcome of treating bladder dysfunction with clean intermittent catheterization and overnight drainage via a Mitrofanoff appendicovesicostomy with respect to upper tract imaging, urodynamic findings and renal function.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients were established on a clean intermittent catheterization program via the Mitrofanoff stoma, including 3 or 4 daytime catheterizations and overnight drainage with an indwelling catheter. We analyzed trends in serum creatinine, renal ultrasound appearance and urodynamic data.<br />RESULTS: Mitrofanoff formation was performed in 24 patients with valve bladder syndrome. Median followup was 6.2 years. Hydronephrosis, quantified by combined anteroposterior diameter measurements of the renal pelvis, significantly improved with a mean combined anteroposterior diameter reduction of 14.2 mm (95% CI 7.6-20.9, p â‰¤ 0.001). Overall bladder dysfunction improved. Capacity was decreased in 9 of 12 patients (75%) initially compared with 12 of 21 (57%) after Mitrofanoff surgery (p = 0.457). Compliance was poor in 75% of patients initially vs 28.6% at followup (p = 0.014). Despite improvements in hydronephrosis and urodynamic parameters the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate deteriorated. End stage renal failure developed in 35% of cases during followup.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of valve bladder with clean intermittent catheterization and overnight drainage via a Mitrofanoff stoma can achieve significant improvements in hydronephrosis and bladder dysfunction urodynamic parameters.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is believed to be one of the common causes of enterically transmitted acute hepatitis in developing countries and is rare in developed countries, except in patients with a history of travel. However, an increasing number of chronic HEV infection cases have recently been reported in developed countries. In these countries, immunosuppressed patients with HEV infection, such as organ transplant recipients, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients or patients with haematological malignancies, could develop chronic hepatitis E (CHE) infection. Approximately 60% of HEV infections in immunocompromised patients after solid organ transplantation evolve to CHE without antiviral treatment. Clinical manifestations of CHE are often nonspecific symptoms. Many patients with CHE infection are asymptomatic, but some have jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain, fever and asthenia. Several extrahepatic manifestations have also been reported. Although chronic HEV infection can result in progressive severe liver failure and cirrhosis, diagnosis is often controversial because of the lack of specific diagnostic criteria. Many CHE cases are diagnosed by HEV RNA-positive serum or stool for >6 months. Immunosuppressive drugs, interferon-alpha and ribavirin have been used for treatment. Diagnostic reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction is useful for estimating treatment efficacy. Preventive measures for HEV infection have been discussed, while systematic guidelines have not yet been reported.","24383921","2014","2"

The aim of this study was to identify the most influential and modifiable risk factors for sarcopenia in elderly.<br />METHODS: This was a population-based, cross-sectional study using data from the Fourth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES IV), 2008-2009. This study included 940 men and 1,324 women aged 65Â years and older who completed a body composition analysis using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Sarcopenia was defined as an appendicular skeletal muscle mass divided by height(2) of less than 1Â standard deviation below the sex-specific mean for a younger reference group.<br />RESULTS: Using univariate analysis, age, body mass index (BMI), homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), limitations in daily activities, regular exercise, high-risk drinking, family income, osteoporosis, daily energy, and protein intake were associated with sarcopenia in men; age, BMI, limitations in daily activities, regular exercise, occupation, osteoporosis at the total hip, and daily energy intake were associated with sarcopenia in women. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, HOMA-IR â‰¥2.5 (odds ratio [OR] for sarcopenia, 2.27; 95Â % confidence interval [CI], 1.21-4.25), chronic kidney disease stage 3 (OR, 3.13; 95Â % CI, 1.14-8.61), and osteoporosis at the femur neck (OR, 6.83; 95Â % CI, 1.08-43.41) were identified as risk factors for sarcopenia in men.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Insulin resistance, chronic kidney disease, and osteoporosis at the femur neck should be modified to prevent the acceleration of skeletal muscle loss in elderly men.","24846317","2014","9"
"750","Severe Acute Pancreatitis with Complicating Colonic Fistula Successfully Closed Using the Over-the-Scope Clip System.","Case reports in gastroenterology","A 44-year-old man presenting to our hospital emergency room with abdominal pain was hospitalized for hyperlipidemic acute pancreatitis. A pig-tail catheter was placed percutaneously to drain an abscess on day 22. Although the abscess improved gradually and good clinical progress was seen, pancreatic duct disruption was strongly suspected and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed on day 90. An endoscopic nasopancreatic drainage tube was placed, but even with concurrent use of a somatostatin analogue, treatment was ineffective. Surgical treatment was elected, but was subsequently postponed as the abscess culture was positive for extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Drainage tubography showed a small fistula of the colon at the splenic flexure on day 140. Colonoscopy was performed on day 148. After indigo carmine had been injected, a fistula into the splenic flexure of the colon showed blue staining. The over-the-scope clip (OTSC) system was used to seal the fistula and complete closure was shown. A liquid diet was started on day 159 and was smoothly upgraded to a full diet. Following removal of the pancreatic stent on day 180, drainage volume immediately decreased and the percutaneous drain was removed. On day 189, computed tomography showed no exacerbation of the abscess and the patient was discharged on day 194. This case of colonic fistula caused by severe acute pancreatitis was successfully treated using the OTSC system, avoiding the need for an open procedure.","23904844","2013","5"
"751","Placement of a duodenal stents bridge the duodenal papilla may predispose to acute pancreatitis.","Hepato-gastroenterology","BACKGROUND/AIMS: To retrospective evaluate the incidence, predictive factors, and management of acute pancreatitis after placement of duodenal stent in patients with malignant gastroduodenal obstruction.<br />METHODOLOGY: Among 242 patients with symptomatic malignant gastroduodenal obstruction successfully treated with duodenal stent placement, acute pancreatitis occurred in 10 (4.1%) of the patients 1-7 days after stent placement. The variables were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate factors predictive of acute pancreatitis. Management of acute pancreatitis also was evaluated.<br />RESULTS: All patients with acute pancreatitis were presented with abdominal pain and distention with vomiting 1-7 days after stent placement, in which 7 patients developed acute janudice. Four patients were cured by fasting and intravenous nutrition, and the remaining 6 cases were managed with percutaneous cholangiography and drain placement (PTCD). Univariate analysis showed acute pancreatitis was associated with location in the descending duodenum (p = 0.001) and stent bridge the duodenal papilla (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis exhibited that the presence of stent bridged the duodenal papilla (odds ratio (OR), 18.48; 95% CI, 2.298-148.48; p = 0.006) was independent predictors of acute pancreatitis.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Acute pancreatitis is an uncommon early complication of placement of duodenal stents in patients with malignant gastroduodenal obstruction. Acute pancreatitis occurred most commonly in descending duodenum, and in patients with stent bridged the duodenal papilla. Stent bridged the duodenal papilla may be the most important predictors for acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis can be managed conservatively or by PTCD when developed to acute jaundice.","24901165",\N,\N
"752","A phase IIA randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to study the efficacy and safety of the selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM), MK-0773 in female participants with sarcopenia.","The journal of nutrition, health & aging","BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass [defined as appendicular LBM/Height2 (aLBM/ht2) below peak value by>1SD], strength and function, is a major contributing factor to frailty in the elderly. MK-0773 is a selective androgen receptor modulator designed to improve muscle function while minimizing effects on other tissues.<br />OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate an improvement in muscle strength and lean body mass (LBM) in sarcopenic frail elderly women treated with MK-0773 relative to placebo.<br />DESIGN: This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-arm, placebo-controlled, multicenter, 6-month study. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either MK-0773 50mg b.i.d. or placebo; all participants received Vitamin D and protein supplementation.<br />SETTING: General community.<br />PARTICIPANTS: 170 Women aged â‰¥65 with sarcopenia and moderate physical dysfunction.<br />MEASUREMENTS: Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, muscle strength and power, physical performance measures.<br />RESULTS: Participants receiving MK-0773 showed a statistically significant increase in LBM from baseline at Month 6 vs. placebo (p<0.001). Participants receiving both MK-0773 and placebo showed a statistically significant increase in strength from baseline to Month 6, but the mean difference between the two groups was not significant (p=0.269). Both groups showed significant improvement from baseline at Month 6 in physical performance measures, but there were no statistically significant differences between participants receiving MK-0773 and placebo. A greater number of participants experienced elevated transaminases in the MK-0773 group vs. placebo, which resolved after discontinuation of study therapy. MK-0773 was generally well-tolerated with no evidence of androgenization.<br />CONCLUSIONS: The MK-0773-induced increase in LBM did not translate to improvement in strength or function vs. placebo. The improvement of strength and physical function in the placebo group could be at least partly attributed to protein and vitamin D supplementation.","23732550","2013",\N

"754","The association of low serum alanine aminotransferase activity with mortality in the US population.","American journal of epidemiology","Elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, an important marker of liver injury, has been associated inconsistently with higher mortality. We evaluated whether persons with nonelevated ALT levels are the most appropriate comparison group by examining the relationships of low ALT with mortality and body composition in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). In NHANES 1988-1994, the mortality risk of persons in ALT deciles 1, 2, 3, and 10 was compared with that of persons in deciles 4-9 (mortality was relatively flat across these deciles) over an 18-year period (through 2006) among 14,950 viral-hepatitis-negative adults. In NHANES 1999-2006, low ALT was evaluated in association with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry body composition measures among 15,028 adults. Multivariate-adjusted mortality was higher for decile 1 (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.24, 1.63), decile 2 (HR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.53), and decile 3 (HR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.50) and nonsignificantly higher for decile 10 (HR = 1.21, 95% CI: 0.91, 1.61) than for deciles 4-9. Adjusted appendicular lean mass was decreased among the lowest ALT deciles. In the US population, low ALT was associated with higher mortality risk, possibly attributable to decreased appendicular lean mass. For mortality studies of elevated ALT levels, the most appropriate comparison group is persons in the middle range of ALT rather than all persons with nonelevated ALT.","24071009","2013","12"
"755","Conservative management of accessory spleen torsion in children.","Minerva pediatrica","Accessory spleen torsion is very rare condition especially in children. The aim of this study is to report the conservative treatment option. In April 2009 we observed a 10-year-old child affected by hereditary spherocytosis who reported acute abdominal pain without fever or vomiting. At hospitalization all blood tests were within normal value. Abdominal ultrasounds showed an increase in spleen volume and a solid round-shaped hypoechogenic formation with hyperechogenic areas in the lower pole without vascolarisation on color-Doppler scan. These findings suggested torsion of the accessory spleen. We opted for a conservative approach: analgesics on demand and antibiotics. After a week symptoms resolved spontaneously and patient was discharged in good health conditions. Follow-up ultrasound scans were performed at one week, three-six months and one year after hospitalization and showed a progressive reduction of the dimensions of the solid round-shaped formation. Accessory spleen torsion needs to be added to the differential diagnosis of cases of acute abdomen in children. Ultrasounds with eco-color-Doppler scans seem to be the best option for the diagnosis of such condition in the pediatric age since other diagnostic methods are more invasive and require sedation of patients. Once accessory spleen torsion is correctly diagnosed it is possible to opt for its conservative treatment.","24051978","2013","8"

Our aim was to investigate whether the treatment of acute diverticulitis can be treated with intravenous antibiotics plus orally administrated DBT than intravenous antibiotics alone. A retrospective nonrandomized open-label trial was established to compare patients with acute diverticulitis who received oral DBT associated with intravenous antibiotics with those who received intravenous antibiotic alone. We included 34 patients, eleven patients in group 1 with DBT and 23 patients in group 2 without DBT. Both groups were comparable in patient demographics and clinical characteristics. There was a significantly better outcome in the group treated with DBT than in the group without DBT when comparing duration of fever, abdominal pain, and antibiotics administration. A trend toward a day shorter mean hospital stay and fasting was seen in group 1, although this did not reach statistical significance. In conclusion, most patients with acute diverticulitis can be managed safely with oral DBT. Although randomized, double-blind study must be done, we could show the possibility to use daiobotanpito as an additional option in treating acute diverticulitis.","24078823","2013",\N

The comprehensive medical data included systemic examinations and germline RET gene screening.<br />RESULTS: Among 68 patients belonging to 13 MEN2A families, 32 (47.1%) presented with PHEO. There were 19 males and 13 females with a mean age of (41 Â± 12) years. And the mean maximum diameter of PHEO was (4.6 Â± 2.2) cm. The diagnosis of PHEO was made after medullary thyroid carcinoma (n = 12, 37.5%), simultaneously (n = 12, 37.5%), initially (n = 7, 21.9%) and death during appendectomy for PHEO-induced hypertensive crisis (n = 1, 3.1%). The diagnosis of PHEO was made before (n = 22) or after (n = 10) clinical screening. The former had 12 symptomatic cases while the latter only 1 case (12/22 vs 1/10, P = 0.024).Except for 5 asymtomatic fatal cases during non-PHEO operations, bilateral PHEO was found in 17 cases including 3 unilaterally treated cases developing another PHEO in contralateral adrenal with a lag period of 5, 10 and 17 years. There were 7 symptomatic patients in bilateral cases versus 6 in unilateral cases (7/17 vs 6/10, P = 0.440). Twenty-five patients underwent PHEO surgery: laparascopic approach in 14 cases (8 with bilateral simultaneous adrenalectomy) and open approach in 11 (2 with bilateral simultaneous adrenalectomy). And 10 patients undergoing bilateral adrenal-sparing operations or adrenalectomy required hormonal replacement therapy. During a mean observation period of 72 (1-282) months, no local recurrence, distant metastasis or Addisonian crisis were noted in 25 cases (contralateral relapse in 3 cases). Among them, 2 cases developed adrenocortical insufficiency unresponsive to an adjustment of hormonal doses.RET screening showed 4 recurrent missense substitutions in 32 MEN2A-PHEO patients: p. C634Y exon 11 (n = 27, 84.4%), p. C634R exon 11 (n = 3, 9.4%), p. C634F exon 11 (n = 1, 3.1%) and p. C618R exon 10 (n = 1, 3.1%).<br />CONCLUSIONS: The mutations of RET proto-oncognene of PHEO in MEN2A are frequently located at codon 634. A combination of pedigree examination and RET gene screening may facilitate an early diagnosis and early treatment of asymptomatic PHEO patients in MEN2A.Laparoscopic cortical-sparing adrenalectomy for preserving adrenocortical function is a preferred surgical approach.","24169328","2013","7"

We present a case of a 48 year old obese Caucasian female with no significant past medical history who came in with back pain and progressive abdominal swelling for the past three months and was found to have a very large pelvic mass. After preoperative evaluation, including: medical history, physical exam, and imaging studies showing a heterogenous mass 24.6 x 33.0 x 43.1, we predicted that the risk of urinary tract injuries was very high. We used preoperative prophylactic bilateral ureteral catheters to prevent injury. A surgical oncologist was consulted and an exploratory laparotomy was performed with removal of the large multi-lobulated pelvic mass + total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and appendectomy all performed at the same time. Patient had an incidental cystotomy during the procedure, which was repaired intra-operatively. The ureters remained intact with no injuries.

Although no distant metastasis was identified, combination chemotherapy with cisplatin and pemetrexed was administered. Nine days after initiating chemotherapy, the patient developed right lower quadrant abdominal pain and high fever. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis revealed the collection of gas and fluid in the retroperitoneum adjacent to the cecum. The abscess was locally drained; however, the infection continued to spread, with subsequent development of a scrotal abscess. Consequently, appendectomy was performed. The patient recovered well and the lung adenocarcinoma was treated with additional courses of chemotherapy following the remission of the local inflammation.

"760","Multidetector CT of emergent biliary pathologic conditions.","Radiographics : a review publication of the Radiological Society of North America, Inc","Various biliary pathologic conditions can lead to acute abdominal pain. Specific diagnosis is not always possible clinically because many biliary diseases have overlapping signs and symptoms. Imaging can help narrow the differential diagnosis and lead to a specific diagnosis. Although ultrasonography (US) is the most useful imaging modality for initial evaluation of the biliary system, multidetector computed tomography (CT) is helpful when US findings are equivocal or when biliary disease is suspected. Diagnostic accuracy can be increased by optimizing the CT protocol and using multiplanar reformations to localize biliary obstruction. CT can be used to diagnose and stage acute cholecystitis, including complications such as emphysematous, gangrenous, and hemorrhagic cholecystitis; gallbladder perforation; gallstone pancreatitis; gallstone ileus; and Mirizzi syndrome. CT also can be used to evaluate acute biliary diseases such as biliary stone disease, benign and malignant biliary obstruction, acute cholangitis, pyogenic hepatic abscess, hemobilia, and biliary necrosis and iatrogenic complications such as biliary leaks and malfunctioning biliary drains and stents. Treatment includes radiologic, endoscopic, or surgical intervention. Familiarity with CT imaging appearances of emergent biliary pathologic conditions is important for prompt diagnosis and appropriate clinical referral and treatment.","24224584",\N,\N
"761","Is prosthetic repair of the abdominal wall in clean-contaminated surgical interventions possible?","Chirurgia (Bucharest, Romania : 1990)","The present study tries to provide an expressive, customized answer to the question in the title. The study relies on a ten-year experience (2000-2009), evaluated retrospectively on a group of 488 prosthetic repairs of incisional herniae, out of which 432 were performed in a clean environment and 56 cases in a clean-contaminated one. The two groups are superimposable based on the Apache score. The visceral surgical procedures associated to the surgery of the parietal defect were varied (cholecystectomy, appendectomy, enterectomy enterorrhaphy,colectomy colotomy-colorrhaphy, hysterectomy with adnexectomy). The assessment of postoperative suppurative complications showed no significant differences between the two groups (p 0.001). These results lead us to the idea of defining the indication for parietal prosthetic repair in a contaminated environment. The major factors of this decision are: the nature, the source and the amount of the septicinoculum, the duration of exposure, the intensity of the host inflammatory response (more difficult to quantify), and finally the surgical judgment. The last mentioned factor will evaluate the above-mentioned data and will take into account that not all bacterial contaminations are necessarily followed by an established infection. Thus, additional exaggerations - which would mean taking useless, ineffective precautions- as well as negative exaggerations - which would mean hazardous boldness- will be avoided.","24331326",\N,\N

Rural surgeons need efficient and targeted continuing medical education that matches their broader scope of practice. Developing such a program begins with an assessment of the learning needs of the rural surgeon. The aim of this study was to assess the learning needs considered most important to surgeons practicing in rural areas.<br />STUDY DESIGN: A needs assessment questionnaire was administered to surgeons practicing in rural areas. An additional gap analysis questionnaire was administered to registrants of a skills course for rural surgeons.<br />RESULTS: Seventy-one needs assessment questionnaires were completed. The self-reported procedures most commonly performed included laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 44), hernia repair (n = 42), endoscopy (n = 43), breast surgery (n = 23), appendectomy (n = 20), and colon resection (n = 18). Respondents indicated that they would most like to learn more skills related to laparoscopic colon resection (n = 16), laparoscopic antireflux procedures (n = 6), laparoscopic common bile duct exploration/ERCP (n = 5), colonoscopy/advanced techniques and esophagogastroscopy (n = 4), and breast surgery (n = 4). Ultrasound, hand surgery, and leadership and communication were additional topics rated as useful by the respondents. Skills course participants indicated varying levels of experience and confidence with breast ultrasound, ultrasound for central line insertion, hand injury, and facial soft tissue injury.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that surgeons practicing in rural areas have a strong interest in acquiring additional skills in a variety of general and subspecialty surgical procedures.

"764","Management of pancreatic ductal leaks and fistulae.","Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology","Pancreatic duct leaks can occur as a result of both acute and chronic pancreatitis or in the setting of pancreatic trauma. Manifestations of leaks include pseudocysts, pancreatic ascites, high amylase pleural effusions, disconnected duct syndrome, and internal and external pancreatic fistulas. Patient presentations are highly variable and range from asymptomatic pancreatic cysts to patients with severe abdominal pain and sepsis from infected fluid collections. The diagnosis can often be made by high-quality cross-sectional imaging or during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Because of their complexity, pancreatic leak patients are best managed by a multidisciplinary team comprised of therapeutic endoscopists, interventional radiologists, and surgeons in the field of pancreatic interventions. Minor leaks will often resolve with conservative management while severe leaks will frequently require interventions. Endoscopic treatments for pancreatic duct leaks have replaced surgical interventions in many situations. Interventional radiologists also have the ability to offer therapeutic interventions for many leak patients. The mainstay of endotherapy for pancreatic leaks is transpapillary pancreatic duct stenting with a stent that bridges the leak if possible, but varies based on the manifestation and clinical presentation. Fluid collections that result from leaks, such as pseudocysts, can often be treated by endoscopic transluminal drainage with or without endoscopic ultrasound or by percutaneous drainage. Endoscopic interventions have been shown to be effective and have an acceptable complication rate.","24650171","2014","7"

If significant testicular size discrepancy is identified, 32% immediately intervene surgically, while 59% repeat measurements in 6-12 months. When no discrepancy is identified, 36.6% of practitioners discharge their patients with no follow-up, 22.5% refer to an infertility specialist, and 31% evaluate with semen analysis. Fifty-seven percent of practitioners have never sent patients for semen analysis; only 4% send >50% of patients. Of these, 52% and 27% analyzed semen at 17-18 years and 19-20 years, respectively, and 10% send for semen analysis at <17 years.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Our survey demonstrates that there does not appear to be a consensus among pediatric urologists managing asymptomatic grade 2 and 3 varicoceles.

The optimal surgical therapy for low-grade appendiceal neoplasm is controversial; currently, the options include appendectomy, cecectomy, right hemicolectomy, and open or laparoscopic surgery. Due to the risk of pseudomyxoma peritonei, complete resection without rupture is necessary. We have encountered 5 cases of low-grade appendiceal neoplasm and all 5 patients had no lymph node metastasis. We chose the appendectomy or cecectomy without lymph node dissection if preoperative imaging studies did not suspect malignancy. In the present case, we performed cecectomy without lymph node dissection by single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS), which is reported to be a reduced port surgery associated with decreased invasiveness and patient stress compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery. We are confident that SILS is a feasible alternative to traditional surgical procedures for borderline tumors, such as low-grade appendiceal neoplasms.","24868331","2014","5"

The aim of this study was to assess the efficiency of different closure techniques by focusing on the intraoperative and postoperative complications versus cost.<br />METHODS: From June 2011 to June 2013, 333 patients from two different hospitals undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy were included in this study. The patients were divided into two groups based on the technique used for appendiceal stump closure: there were 104 patients in the stapler group and 229 in the loop group.<br />RESULTS: Among the 333 patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy, there were two (0.6%) intraoperative complications and 22 (6.6%) postoperative complications. There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to the intraoperative and postoperative complications. The length of the operation was 7 min shorter when the endoloop was used (p = 0.014). The mean costs of the operation were significantly lower when the loop was used (<euro> 554.93) compared to the stapler (<euro> 900.70) (p = 0.000).<br />CONCLUSIONS: There is no clinical evidence supporting the routine use of endoscopic staplers. The appendiceal stump can be secured safely with the use of endoloops in the majority of patients.

In cases with mobile cecum such as this one, mobilization from inflammatory adhesion of the surrounding structures is easy.<br />CONCLUSION: We conclude that transumbilical single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy is a simple and less invasive method for treating appendicitis associated with intestinal malrotation.","25048727","2014",\N
"770","The prediction of pouch of Douglas obliteration using offline analysis of the transvaginal ultrasound 'sliding sign' technique: inter- and intra-observer reproducibility.","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","STUDY QUESTION: What is the inter-/intra-observer agreement and diagnostic accuracy among gynaecological and non-gynaecological ultrasound specialists in the prediction of pouch of Douglas (POD) obliteration (secondary to endometriosis) at offline analysis of two-dimensional videos using the dynamic real-time transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) 'sliding sign' technique?<br />SUMMARY ANSWER: The inter-/intra-observer agreement and diagnostic accuracy for the interpretation of the TVS 'sliding sign' in the prediction of POD obliteration was found to be very acceptable, ranging from substantial to almost perfect agreement for the observers who specialized in gynaecological ultrasound.<br />WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Women with POD obliteration at laparoscopy are at an increased risk of bowel endometriosis; therefore, the pre-operative diagnosis of POD obliteration is important in the surgical planning for these women. Previous studies have used TVS to predict POD obliteration prior to laparoscopy, with a sensitivity of 72-83% and specificity of 97-100%. However, there have not been any reproducibility studies performed to validate the use of TVS in the prediction of POD obliteration pre-operatively.<br />STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This was a reproducibility study which involved the offline viewing of pre-recorded video sets of 30 women presenting with chronic pelvic pain, in order to determine POD obliteration using the TVS 'sliding sign' technique. The videos were selected on real-time representative quality/quantity; they were not obtained from sequential patients. There were a total of six observers, including four gynaecological ultrasound specialists and two fetal medicine specialists. The study was conducted over a period of 1 month (March 2012-April 2012).<br />PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The four gynaecological ultrasound observers performed daily gynaecological scanning, while the other two observers were primarily fetal medicine sonologists. Each sonologist viewed the TVS 'sliding sign' video in two anatomical locations (retro-cervix and posterior uterine fundus), i.e. 60 videos in total. The POD was deemed not obliterated, if 'sliding sign' was positive in both anatomical locations (i.e. anterior rectum/rectosigmoid glided smoothly across the retro-cervix/posterior fundus, respectively). If the 'sliding sign' was negative (i.e. anterior rectum/rectosigmoid did not glide smoothly over retro-cervix/posterior fundal region, respectively), the POD was deemed obliterated. Diagnostic accuracy and inter-observer agreement among the six sonologists was evaluated. The same sonologist was also asked to reanalyse the same videos, albeit in a different order, at least 7 days later to assess for intra-observer agreement. A separate analysis of the inter- and intra-observer correlation was also performed to determine the agreement among the four observers who specialized in gynaecological ultrasound. Cohen's Îº coefficient <0 meant that there was poor agreement, 0.01-0.20 slight agreement, 0.21-0.40 fair agreement, 0.41-0.60 moderate agreement, 0.61-0.80 substantial agreement and 0.81-0.99 almost perfect agreement.<br />MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Agreement (Cohen's Îº) between all six observers for the interpretation of the 'sliding sign' for both sets of videos in both regions (retro-cervix and fundus) ranged from 0.354 to 0.927 (fair agreement to almost perfect agreement) compared with 0.630-0.927 (substantial agreement to almost perfect agreement) when only the gynaecological sonologists were included. The overall multiple rater agreement for the interpretation of the 'sliding sign' for both video sets and both regions was Fleiss' Îº 0.454 (P-value <0.01) for all six observers and 0.646 (P-value <0.01) for the four gynaecological ultrasound specialists. The multiple rater agreement for all six or all four observers was higher for the retro-cervical region versus the fundal region (Fleiss' Îº 0.542 versus 0.370 and 0.732 versus 0.560, respectively). The intra-observer agreement among the six observers for the interpretation of the 'sliding sign' and prediction of POD obliteration ranged from Cohen's Îº 0.60-0.95 and 0.46-1.0 (P-value <0.01), respectively. After excluding the fetal medicine specialists, the intra-observer agreement for the interpretation of the 'sliding sign' and the prediction of POD obliteration ranged from Cohen's Îº 0.71-0.95 and 0.67-1.0, respectively, indicating substantial to almost perfect agreement. When comparing the four gynaecological observers for the prediction of POD obliteration using the TVS 'sliding sign' (after excluding cases with the POD outcome classified as 'unsure' by the observers), the results for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value were 93.1-100, 92.9-100, 90.9-100, 77.8-100 and 97.7-100%, respectively.<br />LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The 'gold standard' for the diagnosis of POD obliteration is laparoscopy;","23482338","2013","5"
"771","Hyponatremia in children with bronchiolitis admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit is associated with worse outcomes.","The Journal of pediatrics","OBJECTIVE: To characterize the relationship between hyponatremia (serum sodium <135 mEq/L) and clinical outcomes in children ages 1 month to 2 years admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with bronchiolitis.<br />STUDY DESIGN: Single-center retrospective cohort study comprising children who were admitted to the PICU between January 2009 and April 2011. Serum sodium concentrations, collected within the first 2 hours after admission to the PICU, were recorded and associations with clinical outcomes were calculated. Quantitative data are presented as mean Â± SD or percentage. Student t-test, Fisher exact test, and Ï‡(2) analyses were performed as appropriate. Subjects were excluded if they were previously diagnosed with chronic disease that would affect initial serum sodium concentration.<br />RESULTS: Children with bronchiolitis were enrolled (n = 102; age = 10.7 Â± 6.7 months). Twenty-three patients (22%) were diagnosed with hyponatremia within 2 hours of admission. Mortality (13% vs 0%; P = .011), ventilator time (8.41 Â± 2 days vs 4.11 Â± 2 days; P = .001), duration of stay in the PICU (10.63 Â± 2.5 days vs 5.82Â Â± 2.09 days; PÂ = .007), and noninvasive ventilator support (65% vs 24%; P = .007) were significantly different between subjects with hyponatremia vs those without. There were no differences in the number of patients with seizures, bronchodilator use, steroid use, intubation requirement, oxygen use at discharge, or hospital readmission.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients diagnosed with bronchiolitis who present with a serum sodium concentration lessÂ than 135 mEq/L within 2 hours of admission to the PICU fare worse than their cohorts with normonatremia. A prospective study to evaluate the effects of hyponatremia appears justified.","23910686","2013","12"

We present the case of a 52-year-old HLA-B27-positive woman with aortitis of the abdominal aorta and spondyloarthritis.<br />METHODS: In addition to the case reported, a literature search (MEDLINE) for articles published between 1946 and September 2013 was performed using combinations of the MEDLINE subject headings keywords \"spondylarthritis,\" \"ankylosing spondylitis,\" \"reactive arthritis,\" \"psoriatic arthritis,\" \"aortitis,\" and \"abdominal aorta.\" Relevant references were retrieved.<br />RESULTS:<br />CASE REPORT: Our patient presented to the ER in June 2008 with a 3-week history of worsening of severe cramping lower abdominal pain. Her history also included recurrent acute episodes of iritis, which eventually led to enucleation of her left eye despite treatment with corticosteroids. CT of the abdomen showed findings suggesting aortitis of the abdominal aorta. She responded to therapy with prednisone, and follow-up imaging showed eventual resolution of the aortitis. She later went on to be diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis with spondylitis.<br />REVIEW OF LITERATURE: Six previously reported cases of abdominal aortitis in spondyloarthritis were found. Four of these were reported in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, one in reactive arthritis, and one in psoriatic arthritis. The first case reported was in 1958 and the most recent in 2012.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Rheumatologists should be aware of the possibility of abdominal aortitis occurring in their patients with SpA and should consider it as part of the differential diagnosis in a SpA patient with unexplained visceral pain or systemic features out of proportion to clinically apparent disease.","24935530","2014","12"
"773","Standardization of operative equipment reduces cost.","Journal of pediatric surgery","BACKGROUND: We hypothesize that standardizing operative equipment, and reducing variability can safely achieve cost reduction.<br />METHODS: We retrospectively measured supply costs, operative time, intra-operative complications, and length of stay in a cohort of 145 patients at a children's hospital who underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy. A standardized preference card for laparoscopic appendectomy was developed and implemented. Data were prospectively collected on 101 consecutive patients and compared to the retrospective cohort using multiple linear regression. A survey assessing the perception of surgeons, nurses and scrub technologists of the impact of standardization on patient safety, patient care, OR efficiency, and cost was conducted. Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to evaluate associations between clinical role and years of experience with the total level of agreement on the survey.<br />RESULTS: A 20% average reduction was achieved in supply cost per case, with no significant change in operative time (p=0.14), total time in OR (p=0.15), or length of stay (p=0.60). No intra-operative complications were identified in either group. Survey participants agreed that standardization improves cost and safety. Nurses tended to have greater agreement that standardization improved efficiency and patient care compared to other roles (p=0.06).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Standardization of operative equipment can result in a significant cost reduction without impacting quality or delivery of care. Based on average case number per year, a total annual cost savings of >$41,000 could be realized. Survey participants agree that standardization improves cost and patient safety, yet perceptions regarding the impact on efficiency and patient care varied by occupation.","24074655","2013","9"
"774","Handgrip Strength Does Not Represent an Appropriate Measure to Evaluate Changes in Muscle Strength During an Exercise Intervention Program in Frail Elderly People.","International journal of sport nutrition and exercise metabolism","INTRODUCTION: Although handgrip strength is considered a strong predictor of negative health outcomes, it is unclear whether handgrip strength represents a useful measure to evaluate changes in muscle strength following resistance-type exercise training in elderly people. We assessed whether measuring handgrip strength provides proper insight in the efficacy of resistance-type exercise training to increase muscle mass, strength and physical performance in frail elderly.<br />METHODS: Pre-frail and frail elderly (â‰¥65 y) were either conducting a 24 wk resistance-type exercise training or no exercise training. Before, during, and after the intervention, handgrip strength (JAMAR), lean body mass (DXA), leg strength (1-RM), and physical performance (SPPB) were assessed.<br />RESULTS: Handgrip strength correlated with appendicular lean mass (Ï =0.68; P<.001) and leg strength (Ï =0.67; P<.001). After 24 wks of whole body resistance-type exercise training, leg extension strength improved significantly better when compared with the control group (57Â±2 to 78Â±3 kg vs 57Â±3 to 65Â±3 kg: P<.001). Moreover, physical performance improved significantly more in the exercise group (8.0Â±0.4 to 9.3Â±0.4 points) when compared with the control group (8.3Â±0.4 to 8.9Â±0.4 points: P<.05). These positive changes were not accompanied with any significant changes in handgrip strength (26.3Â±1.2 to 27.6Â±1.2 kg in the exercise group vs 26.6Â±1.2 to 26.3Â±1.3 kg in the control group: P=.71).<br />CONCLUSION: Although handgrip strength strongly correlates with muscle mass and leg strength in frail elderly people, handgrip strength does not provide a valid means to evaluate the efficacy of exercise intervention programs to increase muscle mass or strength in an elderly population.","24903908","2014","6"
"775","Car seat safety for preterm neonates: implementation and testing parameters of the infant car seat challenge.","Academic pediatrics","BACKGROUND: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that all preterm neonates undergo a period of observation in a car safety seat before discharge, known as the Infant Car Seat Challenge (ICSC), to monitor for respiratory immaturity and the risk of adverse cardiopulmonary events in the upright position. However, no universal guidelines exist to define appropriate cutoffs for failure of the ICSC. We sought to evaluate regional neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) implementation of the ICSC and to evaluate variation in failure criteria.<br />METHODS: We contacted level II and III nurseries/NICUs in New York/New England (n = 119) to determine if each performed ICSCs, their inclusion criteria, duration of testing, and failure criteria.<br />RESULTS: We contacted 119 institutions and had an 87% response rate (n = 103). Of the institutions that responded, 89% (n = 89) perform ICSCs. Of these 89 with current protocols, 17% did not follow AAP guidelines to test all neonates born <37 weeks' gestation, and 45% did not follow guidelines for test duration. Despite wide variation, most units use thresholds for bradycardia of <80 bpm and desaturation of <90% to determine failure.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Despite AAP guidelines, implementation of ICSCs for preterm neonates is not universal in the region studied. Variation in definition of ICSC failure means that neonates are receiving differential care, not on the basis of their clinical characteristics, but on which institution performs the test. We propose standardizing the test to all infants born at <37 weeks' gestation to a duration of at least 90 minutes, along with a failure threshold for bradycardia of <80 bpm for >10 seconds, and for saturation <90% for >10 seconds.","23680345",\N,\N

Laboratory investigation showed very high peripheral eosinophils levels. After exclusion of the other causes of eosinophilia, a histological bowel sample analysis revealed marked eosinophilic infiltration of a small bowel mucosal layer which confirmed the suspicion of eosinophilic enteritis. Unlike most of the described cases, this patient did not require any specific treatment. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a rare and heterogeneous disease that is probably underdiagnosed in clinical practice because it requires a high degree of suspicion and an endoscopic biopsy for definite diagnosis.","24081600","2013",\N
"777","The role of emergency MRI in the setting of acute abdominal pain.","Emergency radiology","Abdominal pain is one of the most common reasons for patients to present to the emergency department (ED) in the USA, with an estimated seven million visits in 2007-2008, a figure which represents 8Â % (Â±0.2Â %) [2] of all ED visits and a 31.8Â % increase from 1999-2000. Abdominal pain has a broad differential diagnosis that encompasses multiple organ systems and can provide a significant diagnostic challenge to the ED physician. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) currently plays a limited role in the assessment of abdominal pain presenting to the ED in the nongravid population, its utility in the pregnant and pediatric population has already been proven. A proven diagnostic track record, lack of ionizing radiation and the ability to provide excellent tissue contrast without the use of nephrotoxic iodinated contrast, makes MRI an attractive imaging modality. As physicians and patients become more aware of the potential risks associated with exposure to ionizing radiation, ED MRI utilization is likely to increase. In this article, we discuss the MRI appearance of some of the most common diagnoses, which present as abdominal pain to the ED.","24828243","2014","12"
"778","Small bowel obstruction in patients with a prior history of cancer: predictive findings of malignant origins.","World journal of surgery","BACKGROUND: Determining the cause of acute small bowel obstruction (SBO) in patients previously treated for cancer is necessary for adequate management, especially to avoid incorrectly classing the patient as palliative. We aimed to identify predictive factors for a malignant or a benign origin of SBO.<br />METHODS: We retrospectively studied data for all patients with a prior history of cancer who had undergone operations for SBO between January 2002 and December 2011. Of the 124 patients included, 36 patients had a known cancer recurrence before surgery for SBO, whereas 88 had none.<br />RESULTS: Causes of SBO were benign (post-operative adhesions, post-irradiation strictures) in 68 patients (54.8 %) and malignant in 56 (45.2 %). Incomplete obstruction, acute clinical onset, non-permanent abdominal pain, a shorter period between primary cancer surgery and the first episode of obstruction, and a known cancer recurrence were significant predictors of a malignant SBO. Benign causes of SBO were observed in 72.8 % of patients who had no known cancer recurrence, but were observed in only 11.1 % of patients whose recurrences were known. In patients with cancer recurrence-related SBO, post-operative mortality was 28.6 %, with a median overall survival of 120 days. 1 month after surgery, 38 (67.8 %) of these patients tolerated oral intake.<br />CONCLUSION: A benign cause of SBO was observed in half of the patients with a prior history of cancer and in two-thirds of those without known recurrence. Even in the absence of bowel strangulation, surgery must be considered soon after failure of medical management to treat a possible adhesion-related SBO.","24142334","2014","2"

The strain could utilize Acetamiprid as the sole carbon, nitrogen and energy source for growth and metabolized 100 mgL(-1) Acetamiprid within 2.5h. During the degradation of Acetamiprid, one N-deacetylation metabolite, was characterized by FT-IR, GC-MS and NMR analysis. A novel microbial biodegradation pathway for Acetamiprid was proposed on the basis of the metabolite. Compared with uninoculated soils, the addition of the AAP-1 strain into soils treated with Acetamiprid gained a higher degradation rate, and the bacteria community analysis by T-RFLP in contaminated soil recovered after inoculation of the AAP-1 strain. On the basis of these results, strain AAP-1 has the potential to be used in the bioremediation of Acetamiprid-contaminated environments. This is the first report of Acetamiprid-degrading isolate from the genus of Pigmentiphaga.","23624055","2013","6"

This study presents two case reports of ectopic liver. The first case was a 31-year-old male with clinical indication for laparoscopic appendectomy. Laparoscopy identified a perforated appendix and an unknown tumorous lesion in the ligamentum hepato umbilicalis. The patient underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy, intraoperative lavage of the peritoneal cavity, and extirpation of the lesion in the ligamentum hepato umbilicalis. Histopathological examination of the excised tumor revealed that it comprised liver tissue with fibrinous changes. The tumor was completely separate from the liver with no connection. It was classified as an ectopic liver. No further therapy was required. The second case was a 59-year-old male with a tumor on the upper pole of the spleen, incidentally diagnosed in an ultrasound examination. The biopsy raised suspicion of hepatocellular carcinoma. A positron emission tomography-computed tomography examination revealed accumulation of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose only in the tumor. The patient underwent a splenectomy with a resection and reconstruction of diaphragm. After the hepatocellular carcinoma was confirmed, adjuvant therapy (sorafenib) was initialized. The operations and postoperative recoveries were uncomplicated in both cases. Despite the low incidence of ectopic liver and rare complications, it is necessary to maintain awareness of this possibility.

The databases of the pathology and gynaecology departments of two Belgian hospitals were retrospectively searched for all cases of MA. Only patients who received a pre-operative transvaginal ultrasound scan by an experienced ultrasound examiner following the IOTA protocol were included. Ultrasound -characteristics were described and pattern recognition was applied in order to find morphological characteristics typical for MA. Thirty-one cases were found of which five underwent a transvaginal ultrasound. In three out of these five cases a mucocele was described. All three masses had a similar morphology, i.e. a para-ovarian uni-locular tubular mass with a color score of 1. A typical characteristic was the aspect of the cyst content, which resembled whipped cream. Although MA is seldom diagnosed by gynaecologists, transvaginal ultrasound is able to make an accurate diagnosis.

A history of raw fish (sushi) ingestion was recorded. Abdominal CT demonstrated small intestinal dilatation with wall thickening and contrast enhancement. Ascitic fluid was found on the liver surface and in the Douglas pouch. His IgE (RIST) was elevated, and he tested positive for the anti-Anisakis antibodies IgG and IgA. Small intestinal obstruction by anisakiasis was highly suspected and conservative treatment was performed, ileus tube, fasting, and fluid replacement. Symptoms quickly resolved, and he was discharged on the seventh day of admission. Small intestinal anisakiasis is a relatively uncommon disease, the diagnosis of which may be difficult. Because it is a self-limiting disease that usually resolves in 1-2 weeks, a conservative approach is advisable to avoid unnecessary surgery.","24455340","2013",\N

The recurrence rate, size, multiplicity, location, diagnostic criteria score, and predisposing factors were evaluated based on Hinchey's classification of diverticulitis.<br />RESULTS: There were 104 patients with right colonic diverticulitis in this study, and 20 patients (19.2 %) recurred after medical treatment. When the diverticula were not located in the right colon, the recurrence rate was significantly higher than the diverticula located only in the right colon (pâ€‰=â€‰0.004). The recurrence rate of diverticulitis for a single diverticulum was significantly lower than that for multiple diverticula (pâ€‰=â€‰0.02). Of the 20 patients with recurrence, 1 (5 %) patient underwent laparoscopic diverticulectomy due to a misdiagnosis of diverticulitis as appendicitis. The remaining 19 patients (95 %) received nonoperative management and recovered without any sequelae.<br />CONCLUSIONS: The recurrence rate was 19.2 %, and the predisposing factors were the location of diverticula and the multiplicity of primary diverticula. The re-recurrence rate of recurred patients was 26.3 %. The recurred lesions were controlled simply by nonoperative management. Elective surgery was also a treatment option.","24997717","2014","11"

In April, we learnt of 49 acute diarrhoea cases in a village following a wedding banquet. We undertook an investigation to identify the pathogen, source and mode of transmission.<br />METHODS: We interviewed banquet hosts and food handlers to obtain the menu and guest list. Guests were asked about signs and symptoms and onset of illness, time of meal and food or drinks consumed. Rectal swabs were taken from 13 cases for culture. A case-control study was undertaken; cases were guests who had acute diarrhoea within three days after the wedding and controls were guests who remained well during the same time period.<br />RESULTS: There were 256 guests. Of 69 interviewees, 52 got sick (attack rate 75%). Aside from diarrhoea, cases had abdominal pain (94%), vomiting (48%), nausea (42%) and fever (25%). Incubation periods ranged from seven to 51 hours (median 16.5). Rectal swabs from three cases grew Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Among the food and drinks served, vegetable salad with raw octopus was the only one associated with illness (odds ratio: 6.6, 95% confidence interval: 1.3-36.1, PÂ =Â 0.01).<br />DISCUSSION: Vegetable salad with raw octopus was the suspected vehicle for transmission of this Vibrio parahaemolyticus enteritis outbreak. Messages regarding the risks from eating raw seafood were disseminated, and food handlers were advised to cook seafood to high temperatures. Efforts to improve foodborne disease surveillance and food safety are being undertaken.","23908935","2012","10"
"794","Stump appendicitis: a relatively under-reported reality.","BMJ case reports","Stump appendicitis (SA) is a rare and under-reported complication of open as well as laparoscopic appendicectomy. Diagnosis of SA is often delayed and requires a high index of suspicion in those presenting with signs and symptoms of appendicitis and a history of appendicectomy.We presented a case of SA in a 20-year-old man with a history of open appendicectomy. He was managed conservatively using intravenous antibiotics. The risk of SA is influenced by surgical technique; however, it is unclear whether the incidence is higher with laparoscopic or open procedures. There is little evidence guiding the management of SA with the majority of reported cases treated operatively. This diagnosis should be suspected on the basis of history and examination and CT scanning is a useful tool in most adult cases aiding diagnosis. Management may be guided by the progression of the patient's symptoms either towards operative intervention or a conservative approach.","24045755","2013",\N

In addition, the opioid system has a key role in the rewarding effects of morphine, ethanol, cocaine and various other drugs. The authors have focused on G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channel subunits, GIRK2 and GIRK3, which are important molecules in opioid transmission, and found that the SNPs within the GIRK2 and GIRK3 gene region were significantly associated with postoperative analgesic requirements, one of which was also associated with vulnerability to methamphetamine (METH) dependence. Further, by conducting a multistage genome-wide association study (GWAS) in healthy subjects, the authors found that the rs2952768 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was strongly associated with the requirements for postoperative opioid analgesics after painful cosmetic surgery and consistent results were obtained in patients who underwent abdominal surgery. In addition, the SNP also showed significant association with vulnerability to severe drug dependence in patients with METH dependence, alcohol dependence, and eating disorders and a lower 'Reward Dependence' score on a personality questionnaire in healthy subjects. These outcomes provide valuable information for the personalized treatment of pain and drug dependence.","25069259","2013","11"
"796","Single-port laparoscopic appendectomy versus conventional laparoscopic appendectomy: evidence from randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized comparative studies.","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques","BACKGROUND: Single-port laparoscopic appendectomy (SPLA) has gained widespread acceptance and is increasingly performed. The evidence assessing the safety and efficacy of SPLA compared with conventional laparoscopic appendectomy (CLA) is growing; however, very few randomized trials exist and individual studies often have small patient numbers with varying results. We integrated the available data to enhance the current literature by comparing these techniques.<br />METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed to identify studies comparing SPLA and CLA. Operative parameters, postoperative outcomes, and postoperative complications were evaluated. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manage Version 5.0 software.<br />RESULTS: Fifteen studies matched the selection criteria, including 1560 patients (46.1% SPLA, 53.9% CLA). SPLA was associated with longer operative time compared with CLA procedure (P=0.001). There were no significant statistical differences between the SPLA and CLA groups in terms of postoperative outcomes including postoperative visual analog scale pain scores (P=0.12), time to return to diet (P=0.45), time to flatus (P=0.89), leukocyte count (P=0.86) and C-reactive protein level (P=0.70) evaluation after operation, cosmetic satisfaction level (P=0.95), and length of hospital stay (P=0.16). The overall complication rates were not significantly different between the 2 groups (P=0.44). There was no evidence to suggest heterogeneity of trial results.<br />CONCLUSIONS: SPLA shows no benefit over CLA, including even parameters such as postoperative pain and cosmetic results, and, therefore, there is no indication to use this approach over standard laparoscopic appendectomy. SPLA does take longer to perform. Further studies are needed to confirm that the procedure is more costly.","24487152","2014","2"
"797","Morbidity of peripherally inserted central catheters in pediatric complicated appendicitis.","The Journal of surgical research","BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare postoperative outcomes of pediatric patients with complicated appendicitis managed with or without a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC).<br />METHODS: Patients aged â‰¤18 y in the Pediatric Health Information System database with complicated appendicitis that underwent appendectomy during their index admission in 2000-2012 were grouped by whether they had a PICC placed using relevant procedure and billing codes. Rates of subsequent encounters within 30 d of discharge along with associated diagnoses and procedures were determined. A propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis was performed to account for differences in baseline exposures and severity of illness.<br />RESULTS: We included 33,482 patients with complicated appendicitis; of whom, 6620 (19.8%) received a PICC and 26,862 (80.2%) did not. The PICC group had a longer postoperative length of stay (median 7 versus 5 d, P<0.001) and were more likely to undergo intra-abdominal abscess drainage during the index admission (14.4% versus 2.1%, P<0.001), and have a reencounter (17.5% versus 11.4%, P<0.001) within 30 d of discharge. However, in the PSM cohort (n=4428 in each group), outcomes did not differ between treatment groups, although the PICC group did have increased odds for the development of other postoperative complications (odds ratio=3.95, 95% confidence interval: 1.45, 10.71).<br />CONCLUSIONS: After accounting for differences in severity of illness by PSM, patients managed with PICCs had a similar risk for nearly all postoperative complications, including reencounters. Postoperative management of pediatric complicated appendicitis with a PICC is not clearly associated with improved outcomes.","24721604","2014","7"
"798","Mesalamine did not prevent recurrent diverticulitis in phase 3 controlled trials.","Gastroenterology","BACKGROUND & AIMS: No therapy has been proven to prevent the recurrence of diverticulitis. Mesalamine has shown efficacy in preventing relapse in inflammatory bowel disease, and there is preliminary evidence that it might be effective for diverticular disease. We investigated the efficacy of mesalamine in preventing recurrence of diverticulitis in 2 identical but separate phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials (identical confirmatory trials were conducted for regulatory reasons).<br />METHODS: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of multimatrix mesalamine vs placebo in the prevention of recurrent diverticulitis in 590 (PREVENT1) and 592 (PREVENT2) adult patients with â‰¥1 episodes of acute diverticulitis in the previous 24 months that resolved without surgery. Patients received mesalamine (1.2 g, 2.4 g, or 4.8 g) or placebo once daily for 104 weeks. The primary end point was the proportion of recurrence-free patients at week 104. Diverticulitis recurrence was defined as surgical intervention at any time for diverticular disease or presence of computed tomography scan results demonstrating bowel wall thickening (>5 mm) and/or fat stranding consistent with diverticulitis. For a portion of the study, recurrence also required the presence of abdominal pain and an increase in white blood cells.<br />RESULTS: Mesalamine did not reduce the rate of diverticulitis recurrence at week 104. Among patients in PREVENT1, 53%-63% did not have disease recurrence, compared with 65% of those given placebo. Among patients in PREVENT2, 59%-69% of patients did not have disease recurrence, compared with 68% of those given placebo. Mesalamine did not reduce time to recurrence, and the proportions of patients requiring surgery were comparable among treatment groups. No new adverse events were identified with mesalamine administration.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Mesalamine was not superior to placebo in preventing recurrent diverticulitis.

"799","Updated recommendations: an assessment of NICE clinical guidelines.","Implementation science : IS","BACKGROUND: Updating is important to ensure clinical guideline (CG) recommendations remain valid. However, little research has been undertaken in this field. We assessed CGs produced by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to identify and describe updated recommendations and to investigate potential factors associated with updating. Also, we evaluated the reporting and presentation of recommendation changes.<br />METHODS: We performed a descriptive analysis of original and updated CGs and recommendations, and an assessment of presentation formats and methods for recording information. We conducted a case-control study, defining cases as original recommendations that were updated ('new-replaced' recommendations), and controls as original recommendations that were considered to remain valid ('not changed' recommendations). We performed a comparison of main characteristics between cases and controls, and we planned a multiple regression analysis to identify potential predictive factors for updating.<br />RESULTS: We included nine updated CGs (1,306 recommendations) and their corresponding original versions (1,106 recommendations). Updated CGs included 812 (62%) recommendations 'not reviewed', 368 (28.1%) 'new' recommendations, 104 (7.9%) 'amended' recommendations, and 25 (1.9%) recommendations reviewed but unchanged. The presentation formats used to indicate the changes in recommendations varied widely across CGs. Changes in 'amended', 'deleted', and 'new-replaced' recommendations (nâ€‰=â€‰296) were reported infrequently, mostly in appendices. These changes were recorded in 167 (56.4%) recommendations; and were explained in 81 (27.4%) recommendations. We retrieved a total of 7.1% (nâ€‰=â€‰78) case recommendations ('new-replaced') and 2.4% (nâ€‰=â€‰27) control recommendations ('not changed') in original CGs. The updates were mainly from 'Fertility CG', about 'gynaecology, pregnancy and birth' topic, and 'treatment' or 'prevention' purposes. We did not perform the multiple regression analysis as originally planned due to the small sample of recommendations retrieved.<br />CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to describe and assess updated CGs and recommendations from a national guideline program. Our results highlight the pressing need to standardise the reporting and presentation of updated recommendations and the research gap about the optimal way to present updates to guideline users. Furthermore, there is a need to investigate updating predictive factors.","24919856","2014",\N

This paper develops data-driven approaches for automating the construction of order sets that match closely with user preferences and workflow while minimizing physical and cognitive workload.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed and tested optimization-based models embedded with clustering techniques using physical and cognitive click cost criteria. By judiciously learning from users' actual actions, our methods identify items for constituting order sets that are relevant according to historical ordering data and grouped on the basis of order similarity and ordering time. We evaluated performance of the methods using 47,099 orders from the year 2011 for asthma, appendectomy and pneumonia management in a pediatric inpatient setting.<br />RESULTS: In comparison with existing order sets, those developed using the new approach significantly reduce the physical and cognitive workload associated with usage by 14-52%. This approach is also capable of accommodating variations in clinical conditions that affect order set usage and development.<br />DISCUSSION: There is a critical need to investigate the cognitive complexity imposed on users by complex clinical information systems, and to design their features according to 'human factors' best practices. Optimizing order set generation using cognitive cost criteria introduces a new approach that can potentially improve ordering efficiency, reduce unintended variations in order placement, and enhance patient safety.<br />CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that data-driven methods offer a promising approach for designing order sets that are generalizable, data-driven, condition-based, and up to date with current best practices.","24674844","2014","10"

Study subjects were infants > 35 weeks' gestation admitted for hyperbilirubinemia to the general inpatient ward of a large, freestanding pediatric hospital. We developed and implemented a guideline for the inpatient management of jaundiced neonates, with ongoing feedback given to the faculty on group performance. Outcome measures included monthly compliance scores based on American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines for management of neonates > 35 weeks' gestation and the percentage of admitted jaundiced, breastfeeding infants whose mothers received lactation consultation during hospitalization. To determine the AAP compliance score, we reviewed and assigned points to each patient admission for completion of a standard evaluation, avoidance of unnecessary intravenous (IV) fluids and peripheral IV line placement, avoidance of rebound bilirubin checks while in the hospital, and the bilirubin level at discharge.<br />RESULTS: Mean monthly AAP compliance scores increased from 60.5% of total possible points during the baseline period (January 2010-December 2010) to 90.4% during the intervention period (January 2011-December 2011). Lactation consultations increased from 48% during our baseline period to 63% during our early intervention period and to 90% during the last 5 months of our intervention. Length of stay was unchanged during the baseline and intervention periods.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Interprofessional collaboration between nurses and physicians combined with a thoughtful campaign to increase awareness of published guidelines were successful in improving the care of infants admitted with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.","24313095","2013","7"

The push in recent years toward reducing the number of ports required to perform this surgery has led to the development of a single-port laparoscopic appendectomy (SPA). We compared postoperative pain after an SPA using a glove port with a percutaneous organ-holding device (group 1) with that of an SPA using a commercially-available multichannel single-port device (group 2).<br />METHODS: Between March 2010 and July 2011, a retrospective study was conducted of a total of 77 patients who underwent an SPA by three surgeons at department of surgery, Kangbuk Samsung Medical Center. Thirty-eight patients received an SPA using a glove port with a percutaneous organ-holding device. The other 39 patients received an SPA using a commercially-available multichannel single port (Octo-Port or SILS Port). Operative details and postoperative outcomes were collected and evaluated.<br />RESULTS: There were no differences in the mean operative times, times to pass gas, postoperative hospital stays, or cosmetic satisfaction scores between the two groups. The pain score in the first 24 hours after surgery was higher in group 2 than group 1 patients (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the trocar used in group 2 was more expensive than that used in group 1.<br />CONCLUSION: An SPA using a glove port with a percutaneous organ-holding device was associated with a lower pain score during the first 24 hours after surgery because of the shorter fascia incision length and a cheaper cost than an SPA using a commercially-available multichannel single-port device.","24639970","2014","2"

Most published results are surgical case series concerning infected abdominal aorta. In this retrospective study, we assessed clinical features and outcome of patients presenting infectious thoracic aortic aneurysms.<br />PATIENTS AND METHODS: Diagnosis was based upon a combination of imaging evidence for thoracic aorta aneurysm and evidence for an infective aetiology including a culture of a causative pathogen, or a favourable outcome with anti-infective therapy. Retrospective case series.<br />RESULTS: Six men and one woman were included, with a mean age of 66 years. All the patient presented at least one cardiovascular risk factor or atherosclerosis localisation. Fever (71%) and chest pain (42%) were the most common clinical presenting manifestations. The causative pathogens were: Staphylococcus aureus (N=1), Salmonella enteritidis (N=3) and Candida albicans (N=1). The contrast-enhanced computed-tomography disclosed an aneurysm whose diameter reached more than 50 mm (N=5), that increased rapidly in size (N=5), or presented an inflammatory aspect of the aortic wall (N=4). Management was both medical and interventional: surgery (N=3) or endoluminal repair (N=4). Outcome was favourable in six patients; one patient died from aneurysm-related complications.<br />CONCLUSION: Clinical manifestations revealing an infectious thoracic aneurysm are variable. Diagnosis should be considered in patients presenting a rapidly-growing aneurysm, especially in the presence of elevated acute phase reactants. Endoluminal repair constitutes a treatment option. The role of FDG-PET for diagnosis and follow-up remains to be defined.","24321088","2014","6"

Uniformity in reporting of body composition measures will aid in the diagnosis of clinical disorders such as obesity, sarcopenia, and lipodystrophy. At the 2013 International Society for Clinical Densitometry Position Development Conference on body composition, the reporting section recommended that all DXA body composition reports should contain parameters of body mass index, bone mineral density, BMC, total mass, total lean mass, total fat mass, and percent fat mass. The inclusion of additional measures of adiposity and lean mass are optional, including visceral adipose tissue, appendicular lean mass index, android/gynoid percent fat ratio, trunk to leg fat mass ratio, lean mass index, and fat mass index. Within the United States, we recommend the use of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004 body composition dataset as an age-, gender-, and race-specific reference and to calibrate BMC in 4-compartment models. Z-scores and percentiles of body composition measures may be useful for clinical interpretation if methods are used to adjust for non-normality. In particular, DXA body composition measures may be useful for risk-stratification of obese and sarcopenic patients, but there needs to be validation of thresholds to define obesity and sarcopenia. To summarize, these guidelines provide evidence-based standards for the reporting and clinical application of DXA-based measures of body composition.","24183640",\N,\N

Secondary objectives were body weight, abdominal pain, course of APACHE II score, patient's symptoms and quality of life.<br />RESULTS: Twenty of the 56 patients showed low fecal elastase values indicating pancreatic exocrine insufficiency after acute pancreatitis. Median time to recovery from exocrine pancreatic insufficiency was 14 days in the enzyme supplementation group and 23 days in the placebo group but overall differences for primary and all but one secondary endpoint did not reach statistical significance. However, a positive tendency in favour of enzyme supplementation was found for quality of life parameters (FACT-Pa) in all subscores. There were no relevant differences between placebo and oral pancreatic enzyme supplementation detected with respect to safety and tolerability.<br />CONCLUSION: Enzyme supplementation positively effects the course of acute pancreatitis if administered during the early refeeding phase after acute pancreatitis. There is evidence that oral pancreatic enzyme supplementation has a positive impact on the course of the disease and the global health status (less weight loss, less flatulence, improved quality of life). Oral pancreatic enzyme supplementation was safely administered and can be added to the treatment regimen of patients in a refeeding status after severe acute pancreatitis.","24618443","2014","3"

Typically, goblet cell carcinoids are localized in the vermiform appendix. We report the case of a 60-year-old female patient with the diagnosis of a 1.2-cm rectal goblet cell carcinoid tumor discovered during prophylactic proctocolonoscopy. Because of the known aggressive behavior of this entity, a rectosigmoidectomy was performed. The preoperative staging revealed neither local nor systemic spread.

"814","[Clinicopathologic features of intestinal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma].","Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi Chinese journal of pathology","OBJECTIVE: To study the clinicopathologic features, diagnosis and differential diagnosis of intestinal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma.<br />METHODS: The clinical features, histopathology, immunohistochemical findings and follow-up data of 14 cases of intestinal NK/T-cell lymphoma were retrospectively reviewed.<br />RESULTS: The male-to-female ratio was 9:5. The medium age of patients was 45 years. The sites of involvement included small intestine (6 cases), colon (6 cases) or both (2 cases). The main clinical manifestations were an abdominal mass, other gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, as well as systemic symptoms such as fever and cachexia. Intestinal perforation complicated by acute peritonitis might occur in advanced disease. Histologically, the intestinal wall showed full-thickness infiltration by medium-sized atypical lymphoid cells with pleomorphic nuclei, prominent inflammatory background, angiocentric/angiodestructive growth pattern and coagulative necrosis. Immunohistochemical study showed that the tumor cells were positive for CD3Îµ, CD43, CD56, granzyme B and perforin. They were negative for CD20, CD79Î± and MPO. In-situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA (EBER) showed negative signals. A high proliferative index was demonstrated by Ki-67 immunostaining. Follow-up data of 8 cases were available, with duration of follow up ranging from 0.5 to 36 months. Five patients died within 20 months.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal-type primarily involving intestine is rare and tends to carry an aggressive clinical course. The relatively non-specific clinical manifestations of intestinal NK/T-cell lymphoma may result in misdiagnosis in some cases. A comprehensive evaluation of clinical manifestations, pathologic features and immunohistochemical findings is essential for definitive diagnosis.","23928531","2013","4"
"815","Critical ventriculo-peritoneal shunt failure due to peritoneal tuberculosis: Case report and diagnostic suggestions for abdominal pseudocyst.","Surgical neurology international","BACKGROUND: Tuberculous peritonitis (TBP) is a well-known complication of ventriculo-peritoneal (VP) shunt treatment for hydrocephalus resulting from tuberculous meningitis (TBM). However, a case of hydrocephalus unrelated to TBM resulting from VP shunt malfunction due to TBP has not been reported.<br />CASE DESCRIPTION: A 21-year-old male presented with nausea, abdominal pain, and headache. VP and cysto-peritoneal (CP) shunts had been inserted to treat hydrocephalus due to a suprasellar arachnoid cyst, replaced the VP and removed the CP in his childhood. Computed tomography demonstrated acute hydrocephalus and an abdominal pseudocyst surrounding the distal end of the peritoneal tube. Initial laboratory data showed elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level, but no causative pathogen was identified. External drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and of the fluid in the peritoneal cyst was established, and empirical antibiotic therapy was initiated. Bacterial cultures eventually revealed Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, and TBP was diagnosed. The patient responded well to antituberculosis (anti-TB) agents and insertion of a ventriculo-pleural shunt.<br />CONCLUSION: This case highlights the possibility of CSF shunt failure and concomitant neurological sequelae from TB infection even when the pathogen has not invaded the central nervous system, as in TBM. Moreover, TBP is rare in developed countries and therefore may be misdiagnosed because of nonspecific clinical features and low sensitivity of common TB screening methods.","24991474","2014",\N

"817","Statistical Issues in TBI Clinical Studies.","Frontiers in neurology","The identification and longitudinal assessment of traumatic brain injury presents several challenges. Because these injuries can have subtle effects, efforts to find quantitative physiological measures that can be used to characterize traumatic brain injury are receiving increased attention. The results of this research must be considered with care. Six reasons for cautious assessment are outlined in this paper. None of the issues raised here are new. They are standard elements in the technical literature that describes the mathematical analysis of clinical data. The purpose of this paper is to draw attention to these issues because they need to be considered when clinicians evaluate the usefulness of this research. In some instances these points are demonstrated by simulation studies of diagnostic processes. We take as an additional objective the explicit presentation of the mathematical methods used to reach these conclusions. This material is in the appendices. The following points are made: (1) A statistically significant separation of a clinical population from a control population does not ensure a successful diagnostic procedure. (2) Adding more variables to a diagnostic discrimination can, in some instances, actually reduce classification accuracy. (3) A high sensitivity and specificity in a TBI versus control population classification does not ensure diagnostic successes when the method is applied in a more general neuropsychiatric population. (4) Evaluation of treatment effectiveness must recognize that high variability is a pronounced characteristic of an injured central nervous system and that results can be confounded by either disease progression or spontaneous recovery. A large pre-treatment versus post-treatment effect size does not, of itself, establish a successful treatment. (5) A procedure for discriminating between treatment responders and non-responders requires, minimally, a two phase investigation. This procedure must include a mechanism to discriminate between treatment responders, placebo responders, and spontaneous recovery. (6) A search for prodromes of neuropsychiatric disorders following traumatic brain injury can be implemented with these procedures.","24312072","2013",\N

We report a case of exaggerated septic response to a urinary tract infection mimicking AMI in an immunosuppressed diabetic patient. A 56-year-old female was found collapsed at home with a 24 hour history of diarrhoea, a central abdominal pain and a complex past medical history. Examination showed her to be pyrexial, drowsy, profoundly dehydrated with evidence of cardiovascular collapse. She had a tender distended abdomen, raised inflammatory markers, raised lactate of 9.1 u/L and urinalysis was positive for leucocytes and nitrites. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was reported to show small bowel ischaemia. She underwent a negative laparotomy and recovered following management in the intensive therapy unit. The negative laparotomy rate can be reduced by having abdominal CT performed and reported by an experienced radiologist or by the use of diagnostic laparoscopy.","24765273","2011","3"

Unger var. appendiculatus [syn. U. phaseoli (Reben) Wint.]. We report on two random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers OAC20490 tightly linked (no recombinants) in coupling phase and OAE19890 linked in repulsion phase (at 6.2Â±2.8 cM) to PI 181996 rust resistance. These RAPDs, generated by single decamer primers in the polymerase chain reaction, were identified in near-isogenic bulks of non-segregating resistant and susceptible BC4F2 (NX-040*4/PI 181996) lines. Linkage of the RAPD markers was confirmed by screening 19 BC4F2 and 57 BC4F3 individuals segregating for PI 181996 resistance. Utility of the RAPDs OAC20490 and OAE19890 was investigated in a diverse group of common bean cultivars and lines. All cultivars into which the PI 181996 resistance was introgressed had the RAPD OAC20490. A RAPD similar in size to OAC20490, observed in some susceptible common bean lines, was confirmed by Southern blotting to be homologous to the RAPD OAC20490. Use of the RAPDs OAC20490 and OAE19890 in marker-assisted selection (MAS) is proposed. The coupling-phase RAPD is most useful for MAS of resistant BCnF1individuals during traditional backcross breeding. The repulsion-phase RAPD has greatest utility in MAS of homozygous-resistant individuals in F2 or later-segregating generations.","24174024","1995","4"

"821","Association between polymorphisms in the TRHR gene, fat-free mass, and muscle strength in older women.","Age (Dordrecht, Netherlands)","A previous genome-wide association study suggested that polymorphisms in the thyrotrophin-releasing hormone receptor (TRHR) gene contribute to fat-free mass (FFM) variation. The aim of the present study was to examine the association between polymorphisms in the TRHR gene with FFM and muscle strength in older women. Volunteers (n = 241; age = 66.65 Â± 5.5 years) underwent quadriceps strength assessment using isokinetics and fat-free mass by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. TRHR polymorphisms and ancestry-informative markers were genotyped through standard procedures. No significant difference was observed for rs7832552. Regarding the rs16892496, ANCOVA revealed that appendicular fat-free mass (AFFM) and relative AFFM were significantly different between groups (p = 0.04 and p = 0.05, respectively). Individuals carrying A/A and A/C genotypes respectively showed, on average, an extra 1 kg and 900 g of AFFM when compared to C/C genotype carriers. Also, the C/C genotype group presented a significantly higher chance to have reduced muscle strength. The observations presented here provide further evidence that the rs16892496 polymorphism in the TRHR gene may play a role in FFM variation. Moreover, the results bring the novel insight that this genetic variant can present a modest contribution to muscle strength in older women.","23543262","2013","12"

Sarcopenia was defined as 2 SD below the mean of the appendicular skeletal muscle/weight for healthy young adults. Obesity was defined as waist circumference â‰¥ 90 cm for men and â‰¥ 85 cm for women. Levels of physical activity were classified using the metabolic equivalent task method.<br />RESULTS: the prevalence of sarcopenia was 12.1% in men and 11.9% in women. Among those with sarcopenia, obesity was prevalent in 68.3% of men and 65.0% of women. Adjusting for all covariates, compared with those with low physical activity, men who engaged in moderate and high activity were 38% and 74%, respectively, less likely to have sarcopenia (Ptrend < 0.001). In women, the relationship between physical activity and sarcopenia was not significant. For sarcopenic obesity, men participating in moderate [odds ratio (OR) = 0.47; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26-0.87] and high (OR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.12-0.60) physical activity, compared with low activity, had significantly lower risk (Ptrend = 0.001). In women, high physical activity was associated with a lower risk of sarcopenic obesity (OR = 0.43; 95% CI: 0.22-0.86).<br />CONCLUSION: physical activity is associated with a reduced risk of sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity in older Korean adults. There were gender differences in the relationship, with stronger associations observed in men than in women.","23761456","2013","11"
"823","Experimental appendicitis and appendectomy modulate the CCL20-CCR6 axis to limit inflammatory colitis pathology.","International journal of colorectal disease","BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the two spectral variations of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The complex interplay between genetic predisposition, gastrointestinal bacteria, and gut immunity in IBD is yet to be deciphered. The newly described IL-17-secreting subset of CD4+ T cells, called Th17 cells (and its \"Th17 system\"), has been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory changes in inflammatory/autoimmune diseases including IBD. The chemokine ligand CCL20 and its receptor CCR6 are both upregulated in colon biopsy samples during active IBD. Appendicitis and appendectomy (AA) prevents or significantly ameliorates human IBD.<br />METHODS: We pioneered the first animal model of AA. AA was performed on 5-week-old male BALB/c mice, and distal-colon samples were harvested. Mice with two laparotomies each served as sham and sham (SS) controls. RNA was extracted from individual colonic replicate samples (AA and SS groups) and each sample microarray analyzed and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) validated. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) software was used to further analyze the microarray data.<br />RESULTS: Prior AA ameliorates experimental colitis in our murine model. CCL20 expression was significantly suppressed (along with components of the Th17 system) in the most distal colon 3 and 28 days after AA was done at the most proximal colon.<br />CONCLUSION: Teasing out the pathways involved in the changes induced by AA on the colon in clinical studies and, most importantly, in our unique murine AA model will lead to the development of techniques to manipulate different components of the CCL20-CCR6 axis and Th17 system resulting in significant advances in IBD management.","24980688","2014","10"

Door-to-door survey was carried out. Thirteen blood samples were randomly collected from jaundice cases for immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody for hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV). Water samples were collected to test residual chlorine.<br />RESULTS: Total 2,785 individuals were surveyed; of which 240 were suffering from acute viral hepatitis (attack rate (AR) = 8.61%). Out of 13 serum samples, 10 were found positive for HEV IgM antibodies and three cases had IgM antibodies for both HAV and HEV, which confirmed a hepatitis E outbreak. The difference in attack rate of hepatitis of both the sexes was statistically significant (P < 0.001). The attack rate was significantly higher in age groups >12 years of age (P < 0.001). Environmental investigation also confirmed the sewage contamination of drinking water in the distribution system. The attack rate was much higher (29.4%) among those who were exposed to the leaking pipeline than the nonexposed (Ï‡(2) = 574.26, P < 0.01).<br />CONCLUSION: HEV was confirmed as the major etiological agent in this outbreak that was transmitted by contaminated drinking water.

Patient characteristics, operative time, length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, cost-effectiveness, and cosmetic results were analyzed.<br />RESULTS: A total of 88 patients underwent laparoscopic appendectomy, with MLA in 48 patients and TULAA in 40 patients. TULAA was successful in 36/40 patients. There were no significant differences in mean operative time or mean length of stay between the two groups of patients. There were no postoperative complications in the TULAA group. The cost of TULAA was much lower than that of MLA. TULAA also provided nearly scarless surgery.<br />CONCLUSION: TULAA, in which the appendix is exteriorized via a combination of open and laparoscopic techniques, is a safe and effective procedure for treating appendicitis in children. TULAA is a cost-effective treatment that provides excellent cosmetic results.","23975016","2013","11"

The drug is available in East Asia for the treatment of acute pancreatitis.<br />AIM: To study the effect of addition of ulinastatin to standard care on mortality and morbidity in Indian subjects with acute pancreatitis.<br />DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial across 15 centres in India.<br />METHODS: Subjects, aged 18 to 70 years, with acute pancreatitis and elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, were eligible for enrolment. Acute pancreatitis was diagnosed if the patient had at least two of the following criteria: suggestive abdominal pain, serum amylase and/or lipase > 3 times upper limit of normal, and imaging findings of acute pancreatitis. Subjects were classified as having mild or severe acute pancreatitis on the basis of the APACHE II score (< 8 mild, > or = 8 severe). Standard care was given to all subjects as per the treating physician's protocol. Eligible subjects were randomized to receive intravenous infusion of 200,000 IU ulinastatin or placebo in 100 mL of 0.9% saline given over one hour every 12 hours for 5 days.<br />RESULTS: Of 135 randomized subjects, 129 completed the study (mild 62, severe 67). Pancreatitis was due to alcohol intake in a majority (81%) of subjects. Baseline characteristics were similar between the ulinastatin and placebo groups. Efficacy was evaluated in subjects who had received at least 3 days (6 doses) of ulinastatin/placebo. One subject with severe pancreatitis in the ulinastatin group versus six in the placebo group died (p = 0.048). New organ dysfunction developed in 5 ulinastatin vs 4 placebo group subjects (p = 0.744) with mild pancreatitis and 12 ulinastatin vs 29 placebo group subjects (p = 0.0026) with severe pancreatitis. Adverse events were significantly lower in subjects with severe pancreatitis in the ulinastatin group as compared to the placebo group (p = 0.00001). Reduction in serum CRP was not different between the groups. Median hospitalization was shorter by one day in the ulinastatin group; the difference was not significant. There was no infusion-related adverse event.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Ulinastatin prevents new organ dysfunction and reduces mortality in subjects with severe pancreatitis.","24818336","2013","8"
"828","Identification of a gene for pyruvate-insensitive mitochondrial alternative oxidase expressed in the thermogenic appendices in Arum maculatum.","Plant physiology","Heat production in thermogenic plants has been attributed to a large increase in the expression of the alternative oxidase (AOX). AOX acts as an alternative terminal oxidase in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, where it reduces molecular oxygen to water. In contrast to the mitochondrial terminal oxidase, cytochrome c oxidase, AOX is nonprotonmotive and thus allows the dramatic drop in free energy between ubiquinol and oxygen to be dissipated as heat. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-based cloning, we reveal that, although at least seven cDNAs for AOX exist (AmAOX1a, -1b, -1c, -1d, -1e, -1f, and -1g) in Arum maculatum, the organ and developmental regulation for each is distinct. In particular, the expression of AmAOX1e transcripts appears to predominate in thermogenic appendices among the seven AmAOXs. Interestingly, the amino acid sequence of AmAOX1e indicates that the ENV element found in almost all other AOX sequences, including AmAOX1a, -1b, -1c, -1d, and -1f, is substituted by QNT. The existence of a QNT motif in AmAOX1e was confirmed by nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of mitochondrial proteins from thermogenic appendices. Further functional analyses with mitochondria prepared using a yeast heterologous expression system demonstrated that AmAOX1e is insensitive to stimulation by pyruvate. These data suggest that a QNT type of pyruvate-insensitive AOX, AmAOX1e, plays a crucial role in stage- and organ-specific heat production in the appendices of A. maculatum.","21988877","2011","12"

The authors experienced a case of urethral stricture with spontaneous bladder rupture and bilateral hydronephrosis, mimicking obstructive uropathy attributed to cancer metastasis. A 55-year-old woman was admitted with abdominal pain and distension, oliguria, and an elevated serum creatinine level. She had undergone radical hysterectomy for uterine cervical cancer and received post-operative concurrent chemoradiation therapy 13 years previously. Non-contrast enhanced computed tomography showed massive ascites and bilateral hydronephrosis. The initial diagnosis was acute kidney injury due to obstructive uropathy caused by malignant disease. After improvement of her renal function by bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy catheterization, contrast-enhanced computed tomography and a cytologic examination of ascites showed no evidence of malignancy. However, during retrograde pyelography, a severe urethral stricture was found, and subsequent cystography showed leakage of contrast into the peritoneal cavity and cystoscopy revealed a defect of the posterior bladder wall. After urethral dilatation and primary closure of the bladder wall, acute kidney injury and ascites were resolved.","25061470","2014","6"

Inclusion criteria were branch vessel obstruction/compromise, impending rupture as evidenced by periaortic effusion/hematoma, resistant hypertension, persistent pain/symptoms, or aortic growth â‰¥5 mm within 3 months (or transaortic diameter â‰¥40 mm). Remodeling of the dissected aorta, including thrombosis of the false lumen and changes in the true lumen, false lumen, and transaortic diameter, were assessed in patients with available computed tomographic imaging through 2 years.<br />RESULTS: The 30-day mortality rate was 4.7% (4/86) in the overall patient group (5.5% in acute patients and 3.2% in non-acute patients). Freedom from all-cause mortality was 88.3% at 1 year and 84.7% at 2 years (no significant difference between acute and nonacute patients). From baseline to 2 years, the true lumen diameter increased significantly in the descending thoracic aorta and the more distal abdominal aorta, along with a decrease in the false lumen diameter in both aortic segments. A majority of patients had either a stable or shrinking transaortic diameter in the thoracic (80.3% at 1 year and 73.9% at 2 years) or abdominal aorta (79.1% at 1 year and 66.7% at 2 years). Transaortic growth (>5 mm) occurred predominantly in acute dissections. Consistently, a shorter time from symptom onset to treatment was found to predict transaortic growth in the abdominal aorta (P = .03).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular repair of complicated type B aortic dissection with the use of a composite construct demonstrates favorable early clinical outcomes and aortic remodeling. However, patients treated in the acute setting may be prone to aortic growth and may require close observation. Follow-up through 5 years is ongoing.","24560244","2014","6"

The result in athletes may be overestimated due to increase in muscle mass.<br />OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness of fat mass index (FMI) and lean mass index (LMI) determination as indicators of nutritional status and to compare the results with BMI.<br />MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 28 amateur rugby players, male. After being subjected to whole body densitometry by dual X-ray absorptiometry, we determined fat and lean body mass together with other parameters. FMI (fat in kg/height in meters(2)), LMI (lean in kg/height in meters(2)) and appendicular muscle mass index (AMMI, arms and legs musculature in kg/height in meters(2)) were calculated.<br />RESULTS: Using BMI, 18 players were overweight and 4 obese type I. Considering FMI, 7 of them had normal values and high LMI and AMMI, one of them changed from overweight to obese and another one from obese to overweight. Of the 6 players with normal BMI, one of them showed fat excess and another one fat defect. The results changed the assessment of nutritional status in 39% of players.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Although BMI is an appropriate parameter in general population for the assessment of nutritional status, in athletes should be taken into account fat and muscle body percentage and their corresponding indexes. The whole body densitometry appears to be a simple and reliable technique for this purpose.","23164671",\N,\N
"834","The effect on postoperative pain of pulling the rectus muscle medially during open appendectomy surgery.","Minerva chirurgica","AIM: We investigated whether pulling the rectus muscle medially during open appendectomy surgery had any effect on postoperative pain in this study.<br />METHODS: This prospective study was performed on patients 6 years and older who were admitted for acute appendicitis. The patients were divided into two groups, open appendectomy was performed by pulling the rectus muscle medially in the first group and splitting the rectus muscle in the second group. Pain was evaluated in both groups at preoperative and 12 and 24 hour postoperative by using a visual analog scale graded.<br />RESULTS: The first group consisted of 31 and the second group of 30 patients. The preoperative and 12 and 24 hour postoperative pain evaluation results were 8.25 Â± 1.03, 2.96 Â± 1.40 and 1.16 Â± 0.93 in the first group and 8.36 Â± 0.99, 4.90 Â± 1.24 and 2.03 Â± 1.06 respectively in the second group. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups for age, gender, inpatient duration and preoperative pain scores while the 12 and 24 hour postoperative pain scores were lower in the first group than the second group. This difference was statistically significant (P<0.05).<br />CONCLUSION: Performing the appendectomy by pulling the rectus muscle medially in clinics using open appendectomy will provide a more comfortable postoperative period for the children.","24970302","2014","6"

We evaluated the relationship of readmission with perioperative outcomes and examined possible predictors during the postoperative period.<br />RESULTS: Overall 30- and 90-day mortality was 0.7% and 4.8%, respectively, with 25.5% patients readmitted within 90 days after RARC (61% of them were readmitted within 30 days and 39% were readmitted between 31-90 days postoperatively). Infection-related problems were the most common cause of readmission during early and late periods. Overall operative time and obesity were significantly associated with readmission (P = .034 and .033, respectively). Body mass index and female gender were independent predictors of 90-day readmission (P = .004 and .014, respectively). Having any type of complication correlated with 90-day readmission (P = .0045); meanwhile, when complications were graded on the basis of Clavien grading system, only grade 1-2 complications statistically correlated with readmission (P = .046). Four patients needed reoperation (2 patients in early \"for appendicitis and adhesive small bowel obstruction\" and 2 in late \"for ureteroenteric stricture\" readmission); meanwhile, 6 patients needed percutaneous procedures (4 patients in early \"1 for anastomotic leak and 3 for pelvic collections\" and 2 \"for pelvic collections and ureterocutaneous fistula\" in late readmission).<br />CONCLUSION: The rate of readmission within 90 days after RARC is significant. Female gender and body mass index are independent predictors of readmission. Outcomes at 90 days provide more thorough results, essential to proper patient counseling.","24468509","2014","2"

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared SILA with CLA were included.<br />RESULTS: Six RCTs met eligibility criteria, which included a total of 800 patients, 401 in the SILA group and 399 in the CLA group. There were no significant differences in terms of overall complications (odds ratio [OR] 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59-1.47; p = 0.77). SILA had a higher technical failure rate (OR 3.30; 95% CI 1.26-8.65; p = 0.01) and required a longer operative time (mean difference [MD] 4.67; 95% CI 1.76-7.57; p = 0.002). SILA was associated with better cosmetic results (standardized MD -0.4; 95% CI -0.64 to -0.16; p = 0.001) and earlier return to normal activity (MD -0.64; 95% CI -1.09 to -0.20; p = 0.005), although these advantages should be taken with caution due to the small number of studies reporting these two items and the short follow-up in the evaluation of cosmetic results. There were no significant differences in terms of postoperative pain or length of hospital stay between groups.<br />CONCLUSIONS: SILA is comparable to CLA in selected patients, although it is associated with a higher technical failure rate and longer operative time. Further randomized trials are needed to determine if SILA really offers benefits over CLA.","24682257","2014","8"

Participants completed a defined set of tasks on the VRL simulator directly prior to and after the operation: one preparational task (PT), a virtual procedural task with emphasis on fine preparation (VPT) and a navigational manoeuvre for instrument coordination (ICT). VRL performances were evaluated based on the assessed items of the simulator.<br />RESULTS: Overall analysis of the surgeons' performance demonstrated better postoperative results for PT and VPT in 28 and 26 cases (pâ€‰=â€‰0.001 and pâ€‰=â€‰0.034), respectively. No significant difference was found for ICT (pâ€‰=â€‰0.638).

"841","Omental whirl associated with bilateral inguinal hernia: a case report.","Journal of medical case reports","INTRODUCTION: Torsion of the omentum is a rare cause of abdominal pain. It is clinically similar to common causes of acute surgical abdomen and is often diagnosed during surgery. Inguinal hernia is a common condition but not frequently related with torsion of the omentum.<br />CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old Caucasian man came to our emergency department with abdominal pain of the left quadrant and abdominal distension for 2 days. His medical history included an untreated left inguinal hernia in the last year. Computed tomography revealed densification of mesocolon with left omentum \"whirl\" component and other signs of omental torsion. During an exploratory laparoscopy, a wide twist of his omentum with necrotic alterations that extended to the bilateral inguinal hernial content was observed. Omentectomy and surgical repair of bilateral inguinal hernia were performed.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Torsion of the omentum is a rare entity and usually presents a diagnostic challenge. The use of abdominal computed tomography can help diagnosing torsion of the omentum preoperatively and, thus, prevents a surgical approach. Nonetheless, some cases of torsion of the omentum require surgical repair. Accordingly, a laparoscopic approach is minimally invasive and efficient in performing omentectomy.","24985935","2014",\N

Although recurrence rates are 26%-44% after first CRS/HIPEC, the role of repeated CRS/HIPEC has not been well defined. We hypothesize that patients undergoing multiple CRS/HIPEC's have meaningful long term survival.<br />METHODS: A retrospective study of a prospective database of 294 patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) was conducted, of these 162 had PC of appendiceal origin. Twenty-six of these patients underwent 56 CRS/HIPEC. Survival and outcomes was analyzed.<br />RESULTS: The percentage of patients with pre-surgical PCI scores â‰¥ 20 for the first, second, and third CRS/HIPEC was 65, 65, and 25%, respectively. Complete cytoreduction (CC 0-1) at first, second, and, third surgeries was 96, 65 and 75%, respectively. The mean operating time was 10.1 h. There was no 30-day peri-operative mortality. Following the first, second, and third CRS/HIPEC 27, 42, and 50% experienced grade III complications, respectively. Mean follow up was 51, 28, and 16 months from the first, second, and third CRS/HIPEC, respectively. Overall survival rate for the first CRS/HIPEC was 100, 83, 54, and 46% at years 1, 3, 5 and 10, respectively; from the second CRS/HIPEC 91, 53, and 34% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively; and from the third CRS/HIPEC was 75% at one year.<br />CONCLUSION: Repeat CRS/HIPEC can lead to meaningful long term survival rates in patients with appendiceal peritoneal carcinomatosis with morbidity and mortality similar to those of the initial CRS/HIPEC.","24007834","2013","11"
"846","Clinicopathologic and molecular analysis of disseminated appendiceal mucinous neoplasms: identification of factors predicting survival and proposed criteria for a three-tiered assessment of tumor grade.","Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc","Previous studies have demonstrated that the prognosis of disseminated mucinous appendiceal neoplasms is highly dependent upon tumor grade. Reflecting this, the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system now incorporates a three-tier grading system for prognostic staging of mucinous appendiceal tumors. However, the grading criteria are not well described. In order to address this issue, we evaluated clinicopathologic and molecular features of 219 cases from 151 patients with widely disseminated appendiceal mucinous neoplasia treated at our institution between 2004 and 2012. We identified histologic features that were associated with worse overall survival on univariate analysis: destructive invasion, high cytologic grade, high tumor cellularity, angiolymphatic invasion, perineural invasion, and signet ring cell component (all with P<0.0001). We used these morphologic characteristics to classify neoplasms into three grades: AJCC grade G1 lacked all adverse histologic features; AJCC grade G2 had at least one adverse histologic feature (except a signet ring cell component); and AJCC grade G3 were defined by the presence of a signet ring cell component. Patients with AJCC grade G2 and grade G3 adenocarcinomas had a significantly worse prognosis compared with AJCC grade G1 (P<0.0001 for each). A trend toward worse overall survival was identified for patients with AJCC grade G3 adenocarcinomas compared with AJCC grade G2 adenocarcinomas (P=0.07). Our multivariate analysis found that this three-tier grading system was a significant predictor of outcome (P=0.008), independent of other prognostic variables. After controlling for other prognostic variables, AJCC grade G2 was associated with a 2.7-fold increased risk of death (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-6.2) and AJCC grade G3 was associated with a 5.1-fold increased risk of death (95% CI, 1.7-14) relative to grade G1 tumors. Our results indicate that evaluation of a limited set of adverse histologic features allows for the separation of disseminated mucinous neoplasms of appendiceal origin into three morphologically defined and prognostically relevant grades as advocated by the AJCC.","24633196","2014","11"

Hypertriglyceridemia is the third most common cause of acute pancreatitis. The present report aimed to describe a case of hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis, where the therapeutic approach was plasmapheresis. A 48-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital with complaints of \"severe abdominal pain\". She reported the onset of such symptoms as nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain with a burning feeling in the epigastric area. The patient denied having a fever. The initial examination revealed that she was obese, oriented, tachypneic, normotensive, tachycardic, dehydrated, afebrile, anicteric and acyanotic and had normal color. Her abdomen was distended with bowel sounds, tympanic and diffusely painful, which was mostly in the supramesocolic compartment. The initial laboratory exams showed 10.932 mg/dL triglycerides, 1.548 mg/dL cholesterol, 226 mg/dL amylase and 899 mg/dL lipase. The abdominal computed tomography exhibited increased pancreatic volume (Balthazar E). The patient's condition worsened, and she was sent to the intensive care center. Plasmapheresis was performed with no complications. On the 14th day after admission, the patient was discharged from the intensive care center and was sent to the gastroenterology ward, where an oral diet was resumed with good acceptance. The patient progressed well and was discharged from the hospital on the 25th day after admission. High triglyceride levels are necessary to cause pancreatitis, and it is important to exclude the most common causes. Importantly, the therapeutic approach reduced the high hypertriglyceridemia quickly, thereby avoiding tissue damage.","23917833","2012","9"

"851","Obturator hernia: A case report and review of the literature.","International journal of surgery case reports","INTRODUCTION: An obturator hernia is a rare condition but is associated with the highest mortality of all abdominal wall hernias. Early surgical intervention is often hindered by clinical and radiological diagnostic difficulty. The following case report highlights these diagnostic difficulties, and reviews the current literature on management of such cases.<br />PRESENTATION OF CASE: We present the case of an 86-year-old lady who presented with intermittent small bowel obstruction, clear hernial orifices, and right medial thigh pain. Pre-operative CT imaging was suggestive of an obstructed right femoral hernia. However, intra-operatively the femoral canal was clear and an obstructed hernia was found passing through the obturator foramen lying between the pectineus and obturator muscles in the obturator canal.<br />DISCUSSION: Obturator hernias are notorious for diagnostic difficulty. Patients often present with intermittent bowel obstruction symptoms due to a high proportion exhibiting Richter's herniation of the bowel. Hernial sacs can irritate the obturator nerve within the canal, manifesting as medial thigh pain, and often no hernial masses can be detected on clinical examination. Increasing speed of diagnosis through early CT imaging has been shown to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with obturator hernias. However, over-reliance on CT findings should be cautioned, as imaging and operative findings may not always correlate.<br />CONCLUSION: A high suspicion for obturator hernia should be maintained when assessing a patient presenting with bowel obstruction particularly where intermittent symptoms or medial thigh pain are present. Rapid clinical and appropriate radiological assessment, followed by early surgery is critical to successful treatment.","23973903","2013",\N

Cumulative incidence, incidence rates based on person-years of follow-up and relative risk were calculated for patients with inflammatory bowel disease and compared with the background population. The incidence of cancer was determined using a hospital-based data registry from Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada. Demographic data and details about time from diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease to occurrence of cancer, disease extent, inflammatory bowel disease treatment, cancer therapy and cancer evolution were also collected in the inflammatory bowel disease cohort.<br />RESULTS: Eighteen of 590 patients with inflammatory bowel disease developed cancer [cumulative incidence = 3% (95%CI: 1.58-4.52) vs 2% (95%CI: 1.99-2.11) in the background population; RR = 1.5; 95%CI: 0.97-2.29]. The cancer incidence among inflammatory bowel disease patients was 0.53% (95%CI: 0.32-0.84) per patient-year of follow-up. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease had a significantly increased relative risk of urothelial carcinoma (RR = 5.23, 95%CI: 1.95-13.87), appendiceal mucinous cystadenoma (RR = 36.6, 95%CI: 7.92-138.4), neuroendocrine carcinoma (RR = 13.1, 95%CI: 1.82-29.7) and rectal carcinoid (RR = 8.94, 95%CI: 1.18-59.7).

Mental retardation or behavioural disorder increased the risk of postoperative faecal obstruction and constipation RR = 84 (95 % CI 4.3-1600), p = 0.0035. After median follow-up of 4.1 (range 0.6-11) years RP or related condition was cured in 26 patients. Constipation and faecal soiling require management in a total of seven patients.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Long-term results of rectopexy were good. Postoperative complications from mild to moderate grade were unexpectedly frequent. Preoperative neurobehavioural disorder and constipation increase the risk of postoperative problems and should be mentioned in patient counselling.","24990243","2014","8"

Its use was associated with favorable hematological adverse reaction compared to standard regimens. Non-hematological life-threatening complications such as gastrointestinal perforations are extremely rare with pemetrexed use and tend to develop in the distal bowel in patients at risk. We report the case of a 56-years old Arab male, heavy smoker newly diagnosed with Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer with no comorbidities, treated with pemetrexed-cisplatin combination. Four days after the first cycle of chemotherapy, the patient developed a small duodenal perforation that required emergency laparoscopy repair.

"858","Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli: surface protein dispersin increases bacterial uptake of ciprofloxacin.","International journal of antimicrobial agents","Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) causes diarrhoea. The antibiotic of choice for treating EAEC infections is ciprofloxacin. EAEC differs from other subgroups of pathogenic E. coli by having a surface protein, dispersin, which has previously been shown to play an important role in ciprofloxacin susceptibility for EAEC model strain 042. To investigate further the role of dispersin in ciprofloxacin susceptibility, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for 25 clinical isolates, including 15 with dispersin and 10 without. Dispersin-positive strains had a lower MIC than dispersin-negative strains. The mechanism of action behind this observation may be caused by dispersin (i) increasing the bacteria-antibiotic interaction or (ii) facilitating ciprofloxacin access to the intracellular target, DNA gyrase/topoisomerase. To test the role of dispersin in ciprofloxacin sensitivity, EAEC 042 as well as its isogenic mutants, dispersin mutant (042aap) and a mutant in the transporter apparatus gene aatA, believed to be involved in dispersin transport to the bacterial surface (042aatA), were utilised. As predicted, 042 had a higher sensitivity to ciprofloxacin than 042aap, but it was also found that the MIC of 042aatA was similar to 042aap. To address the question of the role of dispersin in ciprofloxacin susceptibility, the concentration of ciprofloxacin bound in biofilms of 042 and 042aap was quantified by treating bacteria with radiolabelled 2-(14)C-ciprofloxacin. The results showed that dispersin did not increase the amount of bound ciprofloxacin as a function of biomass, indicating instead that dispersin facilitates ciprofloxacin access to the intracellular target leading to increased antibiotic susceptibility.","24011504","2013","11"

As bowel viability depends on patency of the mesenteric vessels, prompt diagnosis is essential. Helical multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) provides a rapid, widely available, non-invasive method to promptly evaluate the mesenteric arteries, veins, and abdominopelvic viscera. Given the value of MDCT in diagnosing vascular disease, it is important the radiologist understand technical and imaging findings of mesenteric vascular injury.

We hypothesized that resident participation would prolong operative times and potentially adversely affect postoperative outcomes.<br />OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of general surgery resident participation in surgical procedures on operative times and postoperative patient outcomes.<br />DESIGN: Retrospective study of general surgery procedures performed during two 1-year time periods, 2007 without residents and 2011 with residents. Procedures included laparoscopic appendectomy and cholecystectomy, thyroidectomy, breast procedure, hernia repair, lower extremity amputation, tunneled venous catheter, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. The primary outcome was operative time and secondary outcomes included length of stay (LOS) and mortality.<br />SETTING: Academic general surgery residency program.<br />RESULTS: There were 2280 operative procedures performed during the 2 periods: 1150 with resident involvement (RES group) and 1130 without residents (NORES group). The RES and NORES groups were similar for patient age (42 vs 41, p = 0.14) and male gender (46% vs 45%, p = 0.68), and there was no difference in overall operative time (68min vs 66min, p = 0.58). More specifically there was no difference in operative time (minutes) for specific procedures including laparoscopic appendectomy (67 vs 71, p = 0.8), thyroidectomy (125 vs 109, p = 0.16), breast procedure (38 vs 26, p = 0.79), hernia repair (61 vs 60, p = 0.74), lower extremity amputation (65 vs 77, p = 0.16), tunneled venous catheter (49 vs 47, p = 0.75), and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (49 vs 46, p = 0.76). However, laparoscopic cholecystectomy took slightly longer in the RES group (71 vs 66, p = 0.02). LOS was shorter during the year with resident involvement (2.6 days vs 3.7 days, p = 0.0004) and there was no difference in mortality (0.17% vs 0.35%, p = 0.45).<br />CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference in operative time for common general surgery procedures with or without resident involvement. In addition, resident involvement is associated with a decrease in LOS. This information should be used to change physician and patient negative perceptions regarding resident involvement while performing surgical procedures.","24209642",\N,\N

Thus, the TAP block is said to be suitable for lower abdominal surgery. This study was designed to compare the analgesic efficacy of two different concentrations of ropivacaine for TAP block in patients undergoing appendectomy.<br />METHODS: Fifty-six patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II, aged 18 years and above, undergoing appendectomy were recruited in this prospective, randomized, double-blind study. They were divided into two groups: Group A patients who received 0.5 mL/kg of ropivacaine 0.5% and Group B patients who received 0.5 mL/kg of ropivacaine 0.2% via TAP block under ultrasound guidance. Postoperative pain was assessed using the visual analog scale upon arrival at the recovery room in the operating theatre, just prior to being discharged to the ward, and at 6 hours, 12 hours, 18 hours, and 24 hours postoperatively to compare the effectiveness of analgesia.<br />RESULTS: Intraoperatively, patients in Group B required a significantly greater amount of additional intravenous fentanyl than those in Group A. There were no significant statistical differences in pain scores at rest and on movement at all assessment times as well as in the dose of 24-hour intravenous morphine consumption given via patient-controlled analgesia postoperatively between the two groups.<br />CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of two different concentrations of ropivacaine (0.5% versus 0.2%) given via TAP block was comparable in providing postoperative analgesia for patients undergoing appendectomy.","25016507","2014","6"

It is the result of unintentional incomplete appendectomy with subsequent inflammatory changes in the appendiceal remnant. A retrospective review of the radiology and pathology archives at our institution over an 8-year period yielded six surgically/pathologically confirmed cases. Imaging findings at presentation were evaluated, including appendiceal stump length, appendiceal stump diameter, presence or absence of surrounding stranding in the periappendiceal fat, and presence or absence of complication (perforation or abscess). The CT findings of the six cases had an average surgical specimen appendiceal stump length of 3.5Â cm (range 2.0-5Â cm) and an average appendiceal diameter of 12.3Â mm (range 10-16Â mm). All six cases demonstrated the presence of periappendiceal inflammatory fat stranding on the CT scan. Range of imaging presentation is reviewed with pictorial examples as well as examples of potential false-positive cases (mimics) including Crohn's disease, residual surgical drain tract, and epiploic appendagitis.

"864","The evolution of the appendectomy: from open to laparoscopic to single incision.","Scientifica","Beginning with its initial description by Fitz in the 19th century, acute appendicitis has been a significant long-standing medical challenge; today it remains the most common gastrointestinal emergency in adults. Already in 1894, McBurney advocated for the surgical removal of the inflamed appendix and is credited with the initial description of an Open Appendectomy (OA). With the introduction of minimally invasive surgery, this classic approach evolved into a procedure with multiple, smaller incisions; a technique termed Laparoscopic Appendectomy (LA). There is much literature describing the advantages of this newer approach. To name a few, patients have significantly less wound infections, reduced pain, and a reduction in ileus compared with the OA. In the past few years, Single Incision Laparoscopic Appendectomy (SILA) has gained popularity as the next major evolutionary advancement in the removal of the appendix. Described as a pioneer in the era of \"scarless surgery,\" it involves only one transumbilical incision. Patients are postulated to have reduced post-operative complications such as infection, hernias, and hematomas, as well as a quicker recovery time and less post-operative pain scores, in comparison to its predecessors. In this review, we explore the advancement of the appendectomy from open to laparoscopic to single incision.","24278754","2012",\N

We report 3 cases of this complication.<br />CASE REPORT: A 19-year-old male with thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy underwent BM trephine biopsy to confirm relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Two hours later, he developed severe hypotension and a CT scan revealed a massive RPH, and was treated conservatively. The RPH recurred 2 weeks after chemotherapy and was successfully treated with gel foam embolization. A 55-year-old male with coagulopathy underwent BM trephine biopsy for hyperleukocytosis and thrombocytosis. He developed a large RPH preceded by left lumbar dermatome sensory neuropathy. He was treated conservatively. A 56-year-old overweight woman on aspirin underwent BM trephine biopsy for polycythemia. Twelve hours later she developed severe abdominal pain with hypotension. A CT scan showed a massive RPH and secondary hemothorax. She was treated conservatively and the RPH resolved after several months.<br />CONCLUSIONS: We and others showed that myeloproliferative neoplasm, quantitative or qualitative platelet abnormalities, aspirin, coagulopathy, and obesity are associated with development of RPH following BM trephine biopsy. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial. Correction of coagulopathy and cessation of anti-platelet treatment prior to biopsy can prevent this serious complication.","24298302","2013",\N

"870","Appendiceal neuroendocrine neoplasms in the era of laparoscopic appendicectomy.","ANZ journal of surgery","BACKGROUND: Incidental appendiceal neuroendocrine neoplasms are identified in 1% of surgical resections for suspected appendicitis. A proportion of these patients will require further surgery because of high risk features, which include mesoappendiceal involvement or an involved margin. While an open appendicectomy technique usually involves en bloc mesoappendiceal resection, the increasingly common laparoscopic method often skeletonizes the appendix, leaving the mesoappendix in situ. This retrospective observational study investigates whether routine resection of the mesoappendix rather than skeletonization would reduce the need for further surgery in patients with an incidental finding of appendiceal neuroendocrine neoplasm.<br />METHODS: We included appendicectomies performed over an 11-year period at Auckland City Hospital and identified all cases of incidental appendiceal neuroendocrine neoplasms. Histological data were collected to assess the risk of lymphatic spread and need for further surgery. Mesoappendix resection versus preservation and its effect on the recommendation for further surgery was recorded.<br />RESULTS: An appendiceal neuroendocrine neoplasm was present in 73 (1%) of 7109 appendicectomy specimens. Of these, 10 patients (14%) required right hemicolectomy. Five of these could potentially have been spared the need for further surgery had the mesoappendix been removed en bloc with the appendix.<br />DISCUSSION: We recommend en bloc mesoappendix resection during appendicectomy in order to better stage the neoplasm and reduce the need for unnecessary further surgery.","24877233","2014","5"

Data gaps were identified and a Delphi survey was carried out to obtain consensus on the detection and management of each co-morbidity. The expert panel members for the Delphi survey comprised 10 dermatologists with substantial clinical expertise in managing moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients, as well as a cardiologist and a psychologist (see appendix) with an interest in dermatology. Agreement was defined using a Likert scale of 1-7. Consensus regarding agreement for each statement was defined as â‰¥75% of respondents scoring either 1 (strongly agree) or 2 (agree).<br />RESULTS: The expert panel members addressed several topics including screening, intervention, monitoring frequency, and the effects of anti-psoriatic treatment on each co-morbidity.

"876","Comparison of various methods of mesoappendix dissection in laparoscopic appendectomy.","Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques. Part A","PURPOSE: Although laparoscopic appendectomy is one of the most commonly performed operations, operation procedures vary widely according to the surgeon. In particular, various methods using different instruments have been used for mesoappendix dissection, such as endostapler, endoclip (EC), Harmonic(Â®) (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincinnati, OH) scalpel (HS), electrocautery, and LigaSureâ„¢ (Covidien, Mansfield, MA). Here we compared the results of mesoappendix dissection by EC, HS, and monopolar electrocautery (ME).<br />SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study was performed on 1178 patients who received laparoscopic appendectomy at the Armed Forces Capital Hospital, Seongnam, Korea, from January 2003 to April 2013. Patients receiving mesoappendix dissection involving EC, HS, or ME were enrolled. Patient demographics, pathology of appendix, and perioperative data including operation time, hospital stay, and complications were analyzed. A theoretical model of disposable cost was constructed for each method to compare cost-effectiveness.<br />RESULTS: The average operation time for the 1178 patients was 58.0Â±24.9 minutes for the EC group, 51.4Â±25.5 minutes for the HS group, and 57.7Â±25.7 minutes for the ME group. The time for the HS group was significantly shorter. Hospital stay and complication rates did not differ. Disposable costs were 620,350 South Korean won (KRW) (571 U.S. dollars) for the EC group, 1,041,230 KRW (959 U.S. dollars) for the HS group, and 491,230 KRW (452 U.S. dollars) for the ME group.<br />CONCLUSIONS: The operation time of ME was similar to that of EC. Although HS had a significantly shorter operation time, the operation time of all three methods was under 60 minutes. All three methods had acceptable complication rates. ME was the most cost-effective method and, given the other similarities, can be recommended for mesoappendix dissection in laparoscopic appendectomy.","24206120","2014","1"

Thirty of them were successfully managed with RFCA (RFCA-successful group), while the remaining 12 (28.6%) finally resorted to video-assisted thoracoscopic atrial appendectomy owing to RFCA failure (resort-to-surgery group). We searched for predictors of RFCA failure, and the need for surgery by using a binomial logistic regression model.<br />RESULTS: In the RFCA-successful group, 6 (20.0%) patients experienced recurrence and re-do ablation and 11 (36.7%) AATs originated from distal AAs. In the resort-to-surgery group, the tachycardias involved exclusively distal AAs and required more RFCA attempts compared with those of the RFCA-successful group (1.58 Â± 0.51 vs 1.20 Â± 0.41; P = .0165). During atrial appendectomy, incessant ATs were terminated immediately after resection of the AA at the base. Long-term success was achieved in all 42 patients with a follow-up of 29.1 Â± 17.5 months. No complications occurred. Fourteen patients with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy recovered fully. We identified origin at distal AATs and longer time to tachycardia termination by ablation as predictors of RFCA failure and the need for surgical intervention.<br />CONCLUSION: ATs originating from the distal portion of AA were more refractory to RFCA.

The authors have focused on G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channel subunits, GIRK2 and GIRK3, that are important molecules in opioid transmission, and found that the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the GIRK2 and GIRK3 gene regions were significantly associated with postoperative requirements of analgesics including opioids in patients who underwent abdominal surgery and mRNA expression of these genes in postmortem specimens, one of which was also associated with vulnerability to methamphetamine (METH) dependence. Further, by conducting a multistage genome-wide association study (GWAS) in healthy subjects, the authors found that genetic polymorphisms within a linkage disequilibrium block that spans 2q33.3-2q34 were strongly associated with the requirements for postoperative opioid analgesics after painful cosmetic surgery. The C allele of the best candidate SNP, rs2952768, was associated with more analgesic requirements, and consistent results were obtained in patients who underwent abdominal surgery. In addition, carriers of the C allele in this SNP exhibited less vulnerability to severe drug dependence in patients with methamphetamine dependence, alcohol dependence, and eating disorders and a lower 'Reward Dependence score on a personality questionnaire in healthy subjects. Furthermore, the C/C genotype of this SNP was significantly associated with the elevated expression of a neighboring gene, CREB1. The results show that SNPs in this locus are the most potent genetic factors associated with human opioid sensitivity known to date, affecting both the efficacy of opioid analgesics and liability to severe substance dependence. These outcomes provide valuable information for the personalized treatment of pain and drug dependence.","24946391","2014","4"
"879","Neuroendocrine tumors arising in Meckel's diverticula: frequency of advanced disease warrants aggressive management.","Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract","BACKGROUND: Meckel's diverticulum is a common anomaly of the GI tract, which occasionally gives rise to cancer. The most frequent tumors affecting these diverticula are neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), and whether these should be treated in similar fashion as small bowel NETs or appendiceal NETs is unclear.<br />METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted at a single academic medical center between 1998 and 2012. Demographic, radiologic, biochemical, and clinicopathologic data were collected as well as status at last follow-up.<br />RESULTS: Seven patients were identified with NETs involving Meckel's diverticula, including one with limited information other than management of her late metastases. Of the six other patients, all had involvement of regional nodes, including three patients with tumors <2 cm in size, and four had liver metastases at presentation.<br />CONCLUSIONS: NETs in Meckel's diverticula are rare tumors, but when they develop, are often associated with nodal metastases and liver metastases, even when the tumors are small. Therefore, optimal management of these NETs is small bowel resection with regional lymphadenectomy and debulking of liver metastases where feasible.","23558715","2013","6"
"880","Structural analysis of cortical porosity applied to HR-pQCT data.","Medical physics","PURPOSE: The investigation of cortical porosity is an important aspect of understanding biological, pathoetiological, and biomechanical processes occurring within the skeleton. With the emergence of HR-pQCT as a noninvasive tool suitable for clinical use, cortical porosity at appendicular sites can be directly visualized in vivo. The aim of this study was to introduce a novel topological analysis of the cortical pore network for HR-pQCT data and determine the influence of resolution on measures of cortical pore network microstructure and topology.<br />METHODS: Cadaveric radii were scanned using HR-pQCT at two different voxel sizes (41 and 82 Î¼m) and also using Î¼CT at a voxel size of 18 Î¼m. HR-pQCT and Î¼CT image sets were spatially coregistered. Segmentation and quantification of cortical porosity (Ct.Po) and mean pore diameter (Ct.Po.Dm) were achieved using an established extended cortical analysis technique. Topological classification of individual pores was performed using topology-preserving skeletonization and multicolor dilation algorithms. Based on the pore skeleton topological classification, the following parameters were quantified: total number of planar surface-skeleton canals (N.Slabs), tubular curve-skeleton canals (N.Tubes), and junction elements (N.Junctions), mean slab volume (Slab.Vol), mean tube volume (Tube.Vol), mean slab orientation (Slab.Î¸), mean tube orientation (Tube.Î¸), N.Slabs/N.Tubes, and integral (total) slab volume/integral tube volume (iSlab.Vol/iTube.Vol). An in vivo reproducibility study was also conducted to assess short-term precision of the topology parameters. Precision error was characterized using root mean square coefficient of variation (RMSCV%).<br />RESULTS: Correlations to Î¼CT values for Ct.Po were significant for both the 41 and 82 Î¼m HR-pQCT data (41: r(2) = 0.82, p < 0.001, 82: r(2) = 0.75, p < 0.001). For Ct.Po.Dm, only the 41 Î¼m data were significantly predictive of Î¼CT values (r(2) = 0.72, p < 0.01) Data at both HR-pQCT voxel sizes were strongly predictive of the Î¼CT values for N.Slabs (41: r(2) = 0.93, p < 0.001; 82: r(2) = 0.84, p < 0.001), N.Tubes (41: r(2) = 0.94, p < 0.001; 82: r(2) = 0.84, p < 0.001), and N.Junctions (41: r(2) = 0.93, p < 0.001; 82: r(2) = 0.78, p < 0.001), though proportional bias was evident in these correlations. Weak correlations were seen for iSlab.Vol/iTube.Vol at both voxel sizes (41: r(2) = 0.52, p < 0.01; 82: r(2) = 0.39, p < 0.05). Slab.Vol was significantly correlated to Î¼CT data at 41 Î¼m (r(2) = 0.60, p < 0.01) but not at 82 Î¼m, while Tube.Vol was significantly correlated at both voxel sizes (41: r(2) = 0.79, p < 0.001; 82: r(2) = 0.68, p < 0.01). In vivo precision error for these parameters ranged from 2.31 to 9.68 RMSCV%.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Strong correlations between Î¼CT- and HR-pQCT-derived measurements were found, particularly in HR-pQCT images obtained at 41 Î¼m. These data are in agreement with our previous study investigating the effect of voxel size on standard HR-pQCT metrics of trabecular and cortical microstructure, and extend our previous findings to include topological descriptors of the cortical pore network.","24387533","2014","1"

We provide a walk through to demonstrate explicitly how Azure can be used to perform these analyses in Appendix S1 and we offer a comparison with a local computation. We note that the use of the Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering of Azure can represent a steep learning curve for bioinformatics developers who will usually have a Linux and scripting language background. On the other hand, the presence of an additional set of libraries makes it easier to deploy software in a parallel (scalable) fashion and explicitly manage such a production run with only a few hundred lines of code, most of which can be incorporated from a template.

Prevention may be achieved by targeting risk factors for recurrent coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with previous history of cardiovascular events. The aim of this trial is to compare the effect of two periodontal treatment approaches on levels of C-reactive protein, lipids, flow-mediated dilation and serum concentrations of proinflammatory and endothelial markers in stable CAD patients with periodontitis over a period of 12 months.<br />METHODS/DESIGN: This is a randomized, parallel design, examiner blinded, controlled clinical trial. Individuals from both genders, 35 years of age and older, with concomitant diagnosis of CAD and periodontitis will be included. CAD will be defined as the occurrence of at least one of the following events 6 months prior to entering the trial: documented history of myocardial infarction; surgical or percutaneous myocardial revascularization and lesion >50% in at least one coronary artery assessed by angiography; presence of angina and positive noninvasive testing of ischemia. Diagnosis of periodontitis will be defined using the CDC-AAP case definition (â‰¥2 interproximal sites with clinical attachment loss â‰¥6 mm and â‰¥1 interproximal site with probing depth â‰¥5 mm). Individuals will have to present at least ten teeth present to be included. One hundred individuals will be allocated to test (intensive periodontal treatment comprised by scaling and root planing) or control (community periodontal treatment consisting of one session of supragingival plaque removal only) treatment groups. Full-mouth six sites per tooth periodontal examinations and subgingival biofilm samples will be conducted at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment. The primary outcome of this study will be C-reactive protein changes over time. Secondary outcomes include levels of total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides, IL-1Î², IL-6, TNFÎ±, fibrinogen, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin. These outcomes will be assessed at all time points over 12 months.

Body composition was determined by body mass index (BMI) and dual-energy-X-ray-absorptiometry (DXA), muscle strength by dynamometry, physical function by the distance walked in 6 minutes (6MWD), forced vital capacity (FVC) by a spirometer.<br />RESULTS: Six participants were of normal weight and 2 overweight based on BMI; all were sarcopenic based on appendicular fat free mass index (AFFMI); and 7 were sarcopenic obese based on AFFMI and % fat mass. Average muscle strength was reduced below 50% of normal. The 6MWD was in BM patients 30% less than normal. FVC was reduced in 4 of the BM patients. Muscle strength had a good correlation with the physical function variables. Correlation between muscle strength and BMI was poor; it was very high with AFFMI. AFFMI was the best single explicator of muscle strength and physical function.<br />CONCLUSION: Muscle mass determined by DXA explains most of the variability of the measures of muscle strength and physical function in patients with BM and UCMD.","24163611","2013",\N

The cecum had appendices epiploicae, and the terminal part of the ileum was retroperitoneal and had ascended vertically to the cecum from the right iliac fossa. Functionally, the sessile part of the ileum might restrict its peristaltic movements. The abnormal position of the terminal ileum might be mistaken for an ascending colon during laparoscopic surgery.

This study assesses QOL outcomes after CRS and HIPEC in an Asian cancer center.<br />METHODS: Patients who completed CRS + HIPEC 6-18 months ago (27 patients) were enrolled in the study. QOL was measured via the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 questionnaires. The scores were compared with a group of 393 disease-free cancer patients, not on active treatment, who had ECOG scores of either 0 or 1. The 1-sample t test was used to compare differences in QOL scores between the 2 groups.<br />RESULTS: A total of 27 patients were analyzed, of which 22 (81 %) were females. Median age was 51 years (15-59 years). CRS + HIPEC were performed for ovarian cancer in 15 patients (55 %), appendiceal carcinoma in 5 patients (19 %), and colorectal carcinoma in 4 patients (15 %). The median intraoperative peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI) score was 15 (2-31) while the completeness of CC score was 0 and 1 in 25 and 2 patients, respectively. The median duration after CRS + HIPEC was 10 months (6-16 months). Global health status and functional and symptom scores were largely similar between patients after CRS + HIPEC and the control group. Cognitive functioning scores and fatigue scores were significantly better in the group after CRS + HIPEC (p = 0.014 and 0.04).<br />CONCLUSIONS: QOL after CRS and HIPEC can be equivalent to that of well-functioning, disease-free cancer patients.","24008554","2013","12"

Chi-square statistics and logistic regression models were used to analyse data.<br />RESULTS: One-hundred and twenty-one (49%) usable surveys were returned from two mailings. On questions regarding comfort levels when performing oral-health-related practices on children under age 3, physicians noted high levels of comfort with all specified oral health practices. Regarding satisfaction of students with medical training, the majority of respondents (87.5%) rated their medical training as fair or poor in preparing them for oral health assessments compared to only 35%, 29% and 7% of respondents giving fair or poor ratings to child abuse identification, caring for special needs patients and primary care paediatric practice, respectively. Additionally, although 90% of respondents noted that the role of primary physicians in counselling/referring children with oral health was important, 60% did not agree with the AAPD and AAP guidelines that state that all children should be referred to a dentist by 12 months of age. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed several statistically significant variables that predict the likelihood of performing various oral-health-related practices. The choice of public-health-oriented future clinical goals, the level of oral health knowledge, how interns rated their oral health training in medical school and the average number of children seen per week, all--to varying degrees--proved important predicator variables for the likelihood of performing them once in practice.<br />CONCLUSIONS: More oral-health-related training of medical students seems warranted and could improve their interest in providing oral-health-related screening and referrals in practice. Increasing student exposure to child patients and increasing exposures to oral health knowledge and problems could be targeted towards students interested in primary care and public health to use resources most efficiently in the effort to combat the growing caries levels amongst young children in Saudi Arabia.","24127762","2013","11"

However, equations for estimating appendicular skeletal muscle mass are population-specific, and few have been developed for older Japanese adults. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to develop and validate an estimate equation for appendicular skeletal muscle mass using bioelectrical impedance analysis.<br />METHODS: A total of 250 older adults aged 65 years and older participated in this study. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and bioelectrical resistance was measured using a multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analyzer. Multiple regression analysis was applied to derive sex-specific estimation formulae using bioelectrical impedance analysis, and a Bland-Altman analysis was used to test agreement.<br />RESULTS: The cross-validation results showed that the slopes and intercepts of the regression lines were approximately one and zero, respectively, and the coefficients of determination and standard errors of the estimate of the newly developed equations were similar between the two groups. Thus, the single sex-specific equations were developed using all participants as follows. Men: appendicular skeletal muscle mass=0.197 Ã— (impedance index)â€‰+0.179 Ã— (weight)â€‰-0.019 (R(2) â€‰=0.87, standard error of the estimate=0.98 kg).

Data from the Human Mortality Database were used and vital statistics from England and Wales are used for illustration. The simpler of these methods involves coplotting mean age of death with its variance, and the more complex of these methods is to present data as a contour plot. The coplot method shows the effect of the 20th century's epidemiological transitions. The contour plot method allows more complex and subtle age, period and cohort effects to be seen. The contour plot shows the effects of broad improvements in public health over the 20th century, including vast reductions in rates of childhood mortality, reduced baseline mortality risks during adulthood and the postponement of higher mortality risks to older ages. They also show the effects of the two world wars and the 1918 influenza pandemic on men of fighting age, women and children. The contour plots also show a cohort effect for people born around 1918, suggesting a possible epigenetic effect of parental exposure to the pandemic which shortened the cohort's lifespan and which has so far received little attention. Although this article focuses on data from England and Wales, the associated online appendices contain equivalent visualizations for almost 50 series of data available on the Human Mortality Database.

Therefore, we aimed to examine surgery as a risk factor for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.<br />METHODS: We searched for observational studies that evaluated the risk for developing multiple sclerosis after surgery that occurred in childhood (â‰¤ 20 years of age) or \"premorbid\" (> 20 years of age). We specifically included surgeries classified as: tonsillectomy, appendectomy, adenoidectomy, or \"surgery\". We performed a systematic review and meta-analyses and calculated odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random effects model.<br />RESULTS: We identified 33 case-control studies, involving 27,373 multiple sclerosis cases and 211,756 controls. There was a statistically significant association between tonsillectomy (OR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.08-1.61; 12 studies, I(2) = 44%) and appendectomy (OR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.01-1.34; 7 studies, I(2) = 0%) in individual's â‰¤ 20 years of age and the subsequent risk for developing multiple sclerosis. There was no statistically significant association between risk for multiple sclerosis and tonsillectomy occurring after age 20 (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 0.94-1.53; 9 studies, I(2) = 32%), in those with appendectomy at > 20 years (OR = 1.26, 95% CI 0.92-1.72; 5 studies, I(2) = 46%), and in those with adenoidectomy at â‰¤ 20 years of age (OR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.68-1.68; 3 studies, I(2) = 35%).

There was no convincing evidence to support the association of other surgeries and the risk for multiple sclerosis. Well-designed prospective etiological studies, pertaining to the risk for developing multiple sclerosis, ought to be conducted and should include the examination of various surgeries as risk factors.","23648120","2013",\N
"899","Intestinal malrotation and volvulus in adult life.","International journal of surgery case reports","INTRODUCTION: Midgut volvulus due to intestinal malrotation is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction when occurring in adult life. This paper documents the difficulties in reaching an early diagnosis.<br />PRESENTATION OF CASE: We describe the case of an 85-year-old man with non-specific abdominal complaints for 20 years, who presented with sudden onset central abdominal pain. An acute median laparotomy under general anaesthesia was performed during which a 360Â° clockwise rotation of the small bowel around the mesenteric pedicle of the superior mesenteric artery and vein was found.<br />DISCUSSION: Malrotation is considered any deviation of the normal rotation of the midgut in embryological development, causing intermittent episodes of gastrointestinal obstruction or acute events of midgut volvulus. Although mainly a paediatric diagnosis, some cases do present in adult life. Radiologic investigations include: upper gastrointestinal contrast studies, Doppler sonography and a contrast enhanced CT of the abdomen. If a true malrotation is diagnosed or found by coincidence, a Ladd's procedure is advised, even if the patient is asymptomatic. There is no proven surgical strategy for preventing the recurrence of small bowel volvulus in case of malfixation of the midgut.<br />CONCLUSION: Non-specific recurrent abdominal complaints in adults of any age should raise suspicion of the possibility of a midgut malrotation or malfixation with or without intermittent volvulus. This case highlights the importance of diagnosis in an early stage.","24709622","2014",\N

The blockage can occur at any level throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The clinical symptoms depend on the level and extent of obstruction. Various benign and malignant processes can produce acute gastrointestinal obstruction, which often represents a medical emergency because of the potential for bowel ischemia leading to perforation and peritonitis. Early recognition and appropriate treatment are thus essential. The typical clinical symptoms associated with obstruction include nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, abdominal pain and failure to pass bowel movements. Abdominal distention, tympany due to an air-filled stomach and high-pitched bowel sounds suggest the diagnosis. The diagnostic process involves imaging including radiography, ultrasonography, contrast fluoroscopy and computer tomography in less certain cases. In patients with uncomplicated obstruction, management is conservative, including fluid resuscitation, electrolyte replacement, intestinal decompression and bowel rest. In many cases, endoscopy may aid in both the diagnostic process and in therapy. Endoscopy can be used for bowel decompression, dilation of strictures or placement of self-expandable metal stents to restore the luminal flow either as a final treatment or to allow for a delay until elective surgical therapy. When gastrointestinal obstruction results in ischemia, perforation or peritonitis, emergency surgery is required.","24160928","2013","10"

The objectives of this case report are to describe a case involving a perforated metastasis of a laryngeal SCC to the ileum and to review the literature pertaining to other similar cases.<br />METHODS: A review of patient's chart and a review of the English literature involving malignant SCC of the larynx with metastasis to the small bowel.<br />RESULTS: We describe the case of a 58-year-old man who had failed induction chemotherapy and underwent a laryngopharyngectomy with bilateral neck dissection and pectoralis major flap for a T4N2c laryngeal SCC. Subsequently, the patient was treated with postoperative radiation and cituximab.The patient went on to present with symptoms consistent with a ruptured appendix, supported by ultrasound imaging. The patient was taken to the operating room where a right hemicolectomy was performed. Pathological gross examination confirmed a 4â€‰cm transmural perforation in the terminal ileum. Microscopy demonstrated deposits of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in the surrounding smooth muscle. Metastatic carcinoma was also found in a separate nodule from the abdominal wall. The patient had an uncomplicated post-operative period, and survived several months thereafter.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Metastasis of laryngeal SCC to the small bowel with perforation is exceedingly rare, but possible. These patients may be successfully managed with resection.","24965761","2014",\N
"902","A traffic-light coding system to organize emergency surgery across surgical disciplines.","The British journal of surgery","BACKGROUND: Emergency surgery is associated with night-time procedures and disruption of elective surgery. An analysis was undertaken of the effect of classifying emergency operations uniformly with a three-tier urgency colour code and the use of dedicated daytime operating rooms.<br />METHODS: Observed changes from 2001 to 2012 in the number, timing and ability to meet the urgency-designated colour code deadline were retrieved from the computer-based operating theatre organization system for all emergency operations.<br />RESULTS: The number of emergency operations performed annually ranged from 3330 to 4341, with an increasing trend. The proportion of night-time emergency operations decreased from 27.4 per cent (2563 of 9347) before to 23.5 per cent (7731 of 32,959) after introduction of the colour coding system in 2004 (Ï‡2 â€‰=â€‰61.94, 1â€‰d.f., Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). In 2007, owing to long preoperative delays in patients with acute appendicitis and acute cholecystitis, colour codes for these patients were upgraded from 'orange' to 'red' and from 'yellow' to 'orange' respectively. The proportion of patients operated on with a red code before and after this change increased from 45.2 per cent (5831 of 12,907 operations) to 62.7 per cent (13,020 of 20,778 operations; Ï‡2 â€‰=â€‰986.99, 1â€‰d.f., Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). In 2012, the office-hours raw utilization time for the principal emergency operation theatre was 85.4 per cent.<br />CONCLUSION: The structural separation of elective and emergency surgery, the use of dedicated daytime operating theatres and the implementation of a universal classification of emergency operations reduced night-time surgery, improved the efficiency of operating theatre utilization during daytime, shortened preoperative delay in patients requiring urgent surgery, and enabled monitoring and corrective actions for providing emergency surgery services.","24272758","2014","1"
"903","Effect of sclerostin-neutralising antibody on periarticular and systemic bone in a murine model of rheumatoid arthritis: a microCT study.","Arthritis research & therapy","INTRODUCTION: Patients with chronic inflammatory diseases have increased bone loss and bone fragility and are at increased risk of fracture. Although anti-resorptive drugs are effective in blocking inflammation-induced bone loss, they are less effective at rebuilding bone. We have previously shown that treatment with sclerostin antibody (Scl-AbI) builds bone and can prevent or restore bone loss in a murine model of inflammatory bowel disease. In this study, we tested the effect of Scl-AbI in a murine model of rheumatoid arthritis (the collagen-induced arthritis model, CIA). We hypothesised that sclerostin blockade can protect and restore bone both locally and systemically without affecting progression of inflammation.<br />METHODS: CIA was induced in male DBA/1 mice, which were treated with either PBS or Scl-AbI (10 mg/kg, weekly) prophylactically for 55 days or therapeutically for 21 days (starting 14 days post onset of arthritis). Systemic inflammation was assessed by measuring the serum concentration of anti-CII IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b by ELISA. Changes in bone mass and structure, either at sites remote from the joints or at periarticular sites, were measured using DEXA and microCT. Bone focal erosion was assessed in microCT scans of ankle and knee joints.<br />RESULTS: Circulating anti-CII immunoglobulins were significantly elevated in mice with CIA and there were no significant differences in the levels of anti-CII immunoglobulins in mice treated with PBS or Scl-ABI. Prophylactic Scl-AbI treatment prevented the decrease in whole body bone mineral density (BMD) and in the bone volume fraction at axial (vertebral body) and appendicular (tibial proximal metaphysis trabecular and mid-diaphysis cortical bone) sites seen in PBS-treated CIA mice, but did not prevent the formation of focal bone erosions on the periarticular bone in the knee and ankle joints. In the therapeutic study, Scl-AbI restored BMD and bone volume fraction at all assessed sites but was unable to repair focal erosions.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Sclerostin blockade prevented or reversed the decrease in axial and appendicular bone mass in the murine model of rheumatoid arthritis, but did not affect systemic inflammation and was unable to prevent or repair local focal erosion.","24432364","2013",\N

She was admitted to hospital as an emergency with vomiting and diffuse abdominal pain. Investigations revealed severe hypercalcaemia and acute renal failure. After correction of the metabolic disturbances with rehydration and biphosphonates, CT scanning of the abdomen, pelvis and thorax showed bilateral interstitial infiltration and splenomegaly. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis was confirmed by endoscopic bronchial biopsies. Progress was satisfactory following withdrawal of the etanercept and corticosteroid therapy in reducing dosage.<br />CONCLUSION: The risk of induced sarcoidosis should be understood in patients receiving anti-TNF therapy and should be considered in cases of hypercalcaemia and/or splenomegaly.","24680117","2014","3"
"905","Gastrointestinal manifestations, diagnosis, and management of hereditary angioedema.","Journal of clinical gastroenterology","Abdominal pain is one of the most common conditions in clinical practice and yet a challenging complaint to accurately diagnose due to the vast number of possible etiologies. When other health care providers cannot identify the cause of abdominal pain, gastroenterologists are often looked upon to help solve the diagnostic dilemma. Consequently, it is incumbent upon gastroenterologists to be well versed in the diagnosis and management of not only common but also rare causes of abdominal pain. One such uncommon but well-described cause of abdominal pain is angioedema of the intestinal tract due to hereditary angioedema. Acute onset, recurrent abdominal pain of varying severity is its most common presenting symptom, and misdiagnosis can not only lead to unnecessary surgical procedures but also death. The purpose of this review is to raise awareness among gastroenterologists about hereditary angioedema as a potential cause of recurrent, unexplained abdominal pain.","24141983",\N,\N

We describe a rare case of acute intestinal necrosis, due to vasculitis, related with chemotherapy. A patient was examined in our emergency department, presenting with abdominal pain. Three months before he had undergone an operation for lung carcinoma (lobectomy) and received chemotherapy. CT of the abdomen demonstrated free air in 10 different locations: hepatic part of the portal vein, branches of mesenteric veins, femoral and iliac veins, the bowel wall, peritoneal cavity and retroperitoneal space, abdominal muscles, inguinal canals, meso-sigmoid space, and in the para-rectal space. Moreover, pathological findings revealed that the free air in the peritoneum and retropneumoperitoneum occurred without intestinal perforation, but with transudation through the necrotic bowel wall. This is a rare complication of chemotherapy. This case refers to the unusual CT findings which appeared in this patient. The key to a better outcome is early diagnosis of this condition and the CT examination of the abdomen plays an important role.","24349710","2013",\N
"907","Gastro-intestinal vascular emergencies.","Best practice & research. Clinical gastroenterology","Gastro-Intestinal Vascular Emergencies include all digestive ischaemic injuries related to acute or chronic vascular and/or haemodynamic diseases. Gastro-intestinal ischaemic injuries can be occlusive or non-occlusive, arterial or venous, localized or generalized, superficial or transmural and share the risks of infarction, organ failure and death. The diagnosis must be suspected, at the initial presentation of any sudden, continuous and unusual abdominal pain, contrasting with normal physical examination. Risk factors are often unknown at presentation and no biomarker is currently available. The diagnosis is confirmed by abdominal computed tomography angiography identifying intestinal ischaemic injury, either with vascular occlusion or in a context of low flow. Recent knowledge in the pathophysiology of acute mesenteric ischaemia, clinical experience and existing recommendations have generated a multimodal and multidisciplinary management strategy. Based on the gastro-intestinal viability around a simple algorithm, and coordinated by gastroenterologists, the dual aim is to avoid large intestinal resections and death.","24160929","2013","10"

Our aim was to describe clinical, biochemical, and genetic features of 108 subjects.<br />METHODS: Between September 2010 and December 2012, 108 subjects with acute porphyrias (90 acute intermittent porphyrias, 9 hereditary coproporphyrias, 9 variegate porphyrias) were enrolled into an observational study. Genetic testing was performed at a central genetic testing laboratory and clinical information entered into a central database. Selected features were compared with data for adults in the US.<br />RESULTS: Most subjects (88/108, 81%) were female, with self-reported onset of symptoms in the second through fourth decades of life. The most common symptom was abdominal pain. Appendectomies and cholecystectomies were common before a diagnosis of porphyria. The diagnosis was delayed by a mean of 15 years. Anxiety and depression were common, and 18% complained of chronic symptoms, especially neuropathic and other pains. The incidences of systemic arterial hypertension, chronic kidney disease, seizure disorders, and psychiatric conditions were markedly increased. Mutations of the known causative genes were found in 102/105 of those tested, with novel mutations being found in 37, including in 7/8 subjects with hereditary coproporphyria. Therapy with intravenous hematin was the most effective therapy both for treatment of acute attacks and for prevention of recurrent attacks.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Acute porphyrias often remain undiagnosed for more than a decade after first symptoms develop. Intravenous hematin is the treatment of choice, both for treatment of acute attacks and for prevention of recurrent attacks.","25016127","2014","12"

Electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation in anterior-lateral leads, but coronary angiogram revealed normal coronary tree and left ventricular angiography showed apical and midventricular akinesis with preserved basal systolic function: a diagnosis of apical ballooning syndrome was made. During the following days, the patient complained about persistent abdominal pain, and a nasogastric tube drained more than 1000 cc of dark fecaloid material. Urgent abdominal computed tomography scan showed a mural thrombus in the apex of the left ventricle and a huge diaphragmatic hernia through which more than one-half of the stomach was herniated and presented a sort of â€œapical stomach ballooning.â€ Gastropexy was done; surgical diagnosis was a type IV giant diaphragmatic hernia complicated by recent gastric volvulus caused by rotation along the longitudinal cardiopyloric axis. Type IV giant diaphragmatic hernia is relatively rare, representing only about 5% to 7% of all hernias. Gastric volvulus is a severe complication, with acute mortality reported to be as high as 30% to 50%. In our case, a severe life-threatening condition as gastric volvulus triggered an apical ballooning syndrome, a transient cardiomyopathy, usually induced by emotional stressors with a long-term good prognosis. Apical ballooning syndrome must be considered an epiphenomenon of other organic diseases that may have an important role in the prognosis of the patient not only in acute but also in chronic setting. Only early determination of the true cause of apical ballooning syndrome ensures a proper treatment.","24079990","2014","1"
"910","CoCoTools: open-source software for building connectomes using the CoCoMac anatomical database.","Journal of cognitive neuroscience","Neuroanatomical tracer studies in the nonhuman primate macaque monkey are a valuable resource for cognitive neuroscience research. These data ground theories of cognitive function in anatomy, and with the emergence of graph theoretical analyses in neuroscience, there is high demand for these data to be consolidated into large-scale connection matrices (\"macroconnectomes\"). Because manual review of the anatomical literature is time consuming and error prone, computational solutions are needed to accomplish this task. Here we describe the \"CoCoTools\" open-source Python library, which automates collection and integration of macaque connectivity data for visualization and graph theory analysis. CoCoTools both interfaces with the CoCoMac database, which houses a vast amount of annotated tracer results from 100 years (1905-2005) of neuroanatomical research, and implements coordinate-free registration algorithms, which allow studies that use different parcellations of the brain to be translated into a single graph. We show that using CoCoTools to translate all of the data stored in CoCoMac produces graphs with properties consistent with what is known about global brain organization. Moreover, in addition to describing CoCoTools' processing pipeline, we provide worked examples, tutorials, links to on-line documentation, and detailed appendices to aid scientists interested in using CoCoTools to gather and analyze CoCoMac data.","24116839","2014","4"

Fallopian tube torsion is a rare cause of acute abdomen, occurring commonly in females of reproductive age. It lacks pathognomonic symptoms, signs, or imaging features, thus causing delay in surgical intervention. Case. We report two cases of isolated fallopian tube torsion in adolescent girls. In the first case a 19-year-old patient presented with acute pain in the left iliac region associated with episodes of vomiting for one day and mild tenderness on examination. Laparoscopy revealed left sided twisted fallopian tube associated with hemorrhagic cyst of ovary. The tube was untwisted and salvaged. In another case an 18-year-old virgin girl presented with similar complaints since one week, associated with mild tenderness in the lower abdomen and tender cystic mass on per rectal examination. On laparoscopy right twisted fallopian tube associated with a paratubal cyst was found. Salpingectomy was done as the tube was gangrenous. Conclusion. Fallopian tube torsion, though rare, should be considered in women of reproductive age with unilateral pelvic pain. Early diagnostic laparoscopy is important for an accurate diagnosis and could salvage the tube.","24251052","2013",\N

The current techniques in interventional endoscopy allow us to access the pancreas and treat some of the complications in a minimally invasive way leading to less morbidity in our patients. Approximately 90% of acute pancreatitis episodes are edematous with early resolution of clinical symptoms and rarely leading to major complications. Patients with necrotizing pancreatitis are susceptible to local and systemic complications particularly in the setting of organ failure. On the other hand chronic pancreatitis is as a chronic inflammatory process that leads to fibrosis of the gland and in occasions to exocrine and/or endocrine insufficiency. The main objective of therapeutic endoscopy in chronic pancreatitis is to relief the obstruction and decreases the pressure in the pancreatic duct with the intention to alleviate abdominal pain. In this review we will address the indications and endoscopic techniques to treat the different complications of pancreatitis such as pseudo cyst drainage, walled off necrosis debridement, disconnected duct syndrome and different options for endoscopic therapy in chronic pancreatitis.","24108377",\N,\N

Elevated cardiac enzymes and electrocardiography result suggested acute non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Emergency coronary angiography demonstrated a 50-90% diffuse stenosis of the proximal and mid right coronary artery also confirmed the diagnosis. Stents were deployed thereafter. However, the patient was found to be concomitant with Standford type B AD by computed tomography angiography due to unrelieved chest pain and new onset of abdominal pain after the operation.

However this is not the situation in developing countries like Nigeria. This may be as a result of local challenges to the performance of laparoscopic procedures. It is important to identify what these challenges are.<br />METHODOLOGY: We prospectively studied problems encountered during the performance of laparoscopic procedures, and their effects on the procedure in a Nigerian teaching hospital for a year. Demographic information, laparoscopic procedure, problems encountered and effect on procedure, and outcomes were analyzed using descriptive statistics.<br />RESULTS: Our sample consisted of 21 patients who had laparoscopic procedures performed by the authors; 12 (57%) were therapeutic procedures. Average age was 34.1 years (range 18-50 years) and majority (61.9%) were female. Problems encountered included non functioning/malfunctioning equipment (76.2%), power outages (33.3%), and dead light source bulbs (14.3%). There were 5 (23.8%) conversions to open surgery as a result of problems encountered; another conversion (4.8%) was to tackle an ascending colon tumour discovered at laparoscopy.<br />CONCLUSION: The performance of laparoscopic procedures in a Nigerian public hospital is affected largely by inadequate and often malfunctioning equipment, and attention to these may reduce rates of conversion to open surgery.","23829125",\N,\N
"929","Internal hernia as a complication of congenital falciform ligament window.","Acta chirurgica Belgica","Commonly, small bowel obstruction (SBO) is caused by either postoperative adhesions or external hernias. Internal hernias are rare, accounting for less than 2% of all cases of intestinal obstruction. An internal hernia through the falciform ligament is extremely uncommon and is usually secondary to a congenital or iatrogenic defect caused by trocars insertion. In this article, we report a case of SBO in a virgin abdomen that appeared to be caused by a congenital defect in the falciform ligament. A search of the literature was done identifying all reported cases of internal hernias caused by falciform ligament defect in order to guide diagnosis and management as well as avoidance of hernias caused by iatrogenic defects.","24941724",\N,\N

Although it is well established that RA leads to bone loss and increased fracture risk, current knowledge on the microstructural changes of bone in RA is still limited. The purpose of this study was to assess the microstructure of periarticular and nonperiarticular bone in female and male RA patients and compare it with respective healthy controls. We performed two high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT; Xtreme-CT) scans, one of the distal radius and one of the ultradistal radius in 90 patients with RA (60 females, 30 males) and 70 healthy controls (40 females, 30 males) matched for sex, age, and body mass index. Volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD), bone geometry, and bone microstructure including trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb.N), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), cortical thickness (Ct.Th) and cortical porosity (Ct.Po) were assessed. At the distal and ultradistal radius, trabecular (p=0.005 and p<0.001) and cortical BMD (p<0.001 and p<0.001) were significantly decreased in male and female patients with RA, respectively. BV/TV was also decreased at both sites, based on lower Tb.N in female RA (p<0.001 for both sites) and lower Tb.Th (p=0.034 and p=0.005) in male RA patients compared with respective healthy controls. Cortical thinning (p=0.018 and p=0.002) but not Ct.Po (p=0.070 and p=0.275) was pronounced in male and female RA patients at the distal radius. Cortical perimeter was increased in male and female RA patients at both sites. Multiple regression models showed that bone geometry (cortical perimeter) is predominantly influenced by age of the RA patient, cortical thickness by both age and disease duration, and trabecular microstructure predominantly by the disease duration. In summary, these data show profound deterioration of bone microstructure in the appendicular skeleton of RA patients at both periarticular and nonperiarticular sites.","24123099","2014","4"
"931","Internal hernias: a brief review.","Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery","Hernias are very familiar to a core surgical trainee in the setting of clinics and the surgical assessment unit. By definition, a hernia is an abnormal protrusion of a viscus from one compartment to another. In clinic, they are visible lumps, exhibiting a cough reflex often with a well definable history making them readily identifiable. In the acute setting, they are the third commonest cause of small bowel obstruction in the developed world. Ventral and inguinal hernias account for the majority of these with only a small proportion due to internal hernias. This article aims to educate the core surgical trainee on the anatomy and distinguishing clinical features of these rare but important types of internal abdominal hernias.","23224076","2013","6"
"932","Recurrent pulmonary exacerbations are associated with low fat free mass and low bone mineral density in young adults with cystic fibrosis.","Journal of cystic fibrosis : official journal of the European Cystic Fibrosis Society","BACKGROUND: In cystic fibrosis (CF), systemic inflammation and pulmonary infections sustain a catabolic response leading to fat free mass (FFM) depletion.<br />OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between recurrent pulmonary exacerbations and alteration in body composition in young adults with CF.<br />METHODS: In a retrospective study we collected body composition data, obtained by DXA scan, on 85 young adults with CF (44 males, mean age 23Â±4years). Whole body and appendicular FFM were divided by height squared to obtain FFM indices (FFMI). Number of pulmonary exacerbations occurred in the year preceding DXA scan were computed and patients were defined as frequent exacerbators if they experienced more than 2 pulmonary exacerbations/year. Body composition data were compared between frequent and infrequent exacerbators.<br />RESULTS: Male patients classified as frequent exacerbators had lower total body bone mineral density (Z-score -1.44Â±1.22 vs. -0.66Â±0.92, P=0.033), whole body FFMI (18.0Â±1.9kg/m(2) vs. 19.3Â±1.4kg/m(2), P=0.024) and appendicular FFMI (7.8Â±1.0kg/m(2) vs. 8.8Â±0.8kg/m(2)P=0.004) compared to infrequent exacerbators. The reduced FFM found in frequent exacerbators was not uniformly distributed and involved mainly appendicular FFM (mean difference: -11% compared to infrequent exacerbators, P=0.016), whereas trunk FFM was not significantly affected by pulmonary exacerbations (mean difference -3% compared to infrequent exacerbators, P=0.34). These differences were not found in female patients.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent pulmonary exacerbations are associated with reduced appendicular FFM and bone mineral density in young male adults with CF. The gender-dependent relationship between pulmonary exacerbations and body composition alteration needs to be further investigated.","24291530","2014","5"
"933","DSM-5 and culture: the need to move towards a shared model of care within a more equal patient-physician partnership.","Asian journal of psychiatry","The universal models employed by psychiatry de-emphasise the role of context and culture. Despite highlighting the impact of culture on psychiatric diagnosis and management in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5, most of the changes suggested remain in the introduction and appendices of the manual. Nevertheless, clinical and biological heterogeneity within phenomenological categories mandates the need to individualise care. However, social and cultural context, patient beliefs about causation, impact, treatment and outcome expectations are never systematically elicited, as they were not essential to diagnosis and classification. Patient experience and narratives are trivialised and the biomedical model is considered universal and transcendental. The need to elicit patient perspectives, evaluate local reality, assess culture, educate patients about possible interventions, and negotiate a shared plan of management between patient and clinician is cardinal for success. The biopsychosocial model, which operates within a paternalistic physician-patient relationship, needs to move towards a shared approach, within a more equal patient-clinician partnership.","24524720","2014","2"

Patients successfully resuscitated after cardiac arrest have a high risk of increased mortality and their poor long-term outcome is often associated with severe neurological complications.<br />CASE OUTLINE: This is a case report of a 67-year-old man after a successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) which was followed by therapeutic hypothermia (TH). The patient visited the dermatological outpatients' department with clinical presentation of pain and swelling of the right leg, shortness of breath and chest pain. During examination the patient lost consciousness, stopped breathing and had cardiac arrest. ECG was done which registered asystole. We began CPR. After 59 minutes of resuscitation return of heartbeat was achieved. The patient was transported to the Emergency Department. On admission, after computerized tomography (CT) of the chest confirmed massive pulmonary embolism (PE), the patient was administered thrombolytic therapy with Metalyse (tenecteplase) and anticoagulation therapy (heparin). After stabilization, therapeutic hypothermia was applied. Combination of EMCOOLSpad on the chest and abdomen and cold Ringer lactate 500 ml at 4 degrees C was flushed. Temperature was decreased to 33 degrees C and kept stabile for 24 hours. After eight days the patient was conscious with a minimal neurological deficit.<br />CONCLUSION: As shown in this case report, and according to the rich experience elsewhere, cooling therapy after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and successful CRP may be useful in preventing neurological complications.","24073561",\N,\N
"935","The HTS barcode checker pipeline, a tool for automated detection of illegally traded species from high-throughput sequencing data.","BMC bioinformatics","BACKGROUND: Mixtures of internationally traded organic substances can contain parts of species protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). These mixtures often raise the suspicion of border control and customs offices, which can lead to confiscation, for example in the case of Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). High-throughput sequencing of DNA barcoding markers obtained from such samples provides insight into species constituents of mixtures, but manual cross-referencing of results against the CITES appendices is labor intensive. Matching DNA barcodes against NCBI GenBank using BLAST may yield misleading results both as false positives, due to incorrectly annotated sequences, and false negatives, due to spurious taxonomic re-assignment. Incongruence between the taxonomies of CITES and NCBI GenBank can result in erroneous estimates of illegal trade.<br />RESULTS: The HTS barcode checker pipeline is an application for automated processing of sets of 'next generation' barcode sequences to determine whether these contain DNA barcodes obtained from species listed on the CITES appendices. This analytical pipeline builds upon and extends existing open-source applications for BLAST matching against the NCBI GenBank reference database and for taxonomic name reconciliation. In a single operation, reads are converted into taxonomic identifications matched with names on the CITES appendices. By inclusion of a blacklist and additional names databases, the HTS barcode checker pipeline prevents false positives and resolves taxonomic heterogeneity.<br />CONCLUSIONS: The HTS barcode checker pipeline can detect and correctly identify DNA barcodes of CITES-protected species from reads obtained from TCM samples in just a few minutes. The pipeline facilitates and improves molecular monitoring of trade in endangered species, and can aid in safeguarding these species from extinction in the wild.

Routine investigations included case history, physical examination, blood biochemistry, ileocolonoscopy and histopathological examination of biopsies. Patients were followed-up after 2 and 6 mo of treatment. The diagnosis of ITB or CD was re-evaluated after 2 mo of antituberculous chemotherapy or immune suppressive therapy respectively, based on improvement in signs, symptoms and laboratory variables. This study was considered to be an exploratory analysis. Clinical, endoscopic and histopathological features recorded at the time of inclusion were subject to univariate analyses. Disease variables with sufficient number of recordings and P < 0.05 were entered into logistic regression models, adjusted for known confounders. Finally, we calculated the odds ratios with respective confidence intervals for variables associated with either ITB or CD.<br />RESULTS: This study included 38 ITB and 37 CD patients. Overall, ITB patients had the lowest body mass index (19.6 vs 22.7, P = 0.01) and more commonly reported weight loss (73% vs 38%, P < 0.01), watery diarrhoea (64% vs 33%, P = 0.01) and rural domicile (58% vs 35%, P < 0.05). Endoscopy typically showed mucosal nodularity (17/31 vs 2/37, P < 0.01) and histopathology more frequently showed granulomas (10/30 vs 2/35, P < 0.01). The CD patients more frequently reported malaise (87% vs 64%, P = 0.03), nausea (84% vs 56%, P = 0.01), pain in the right lower abdominal quadrant on examination (90% vs 54%, P < 0.01) and urban domicile (65% vs 42%, P < 0.05). In CD, endoscopy typically showed involvement of multiple intestinal segments (27/37 vs 9/31, P < 0.01). Using logistic regression analysis we found weight loss and nodularity of the mucosa were independently associated with ITB, with adjusted odds ratios of 8.6 (95%CI: 2.1-35.6) and 18.9 (95%CI: 3.5-102.8) respectively. Right lower abdominal quadrant pain on examination and involvement of â‰¥ 3 intestinal segments were independently associated with CD with adjusted odds ratios of 10.1 (95%CI: 2.0-51.3) and 5.9 (95%CI: 1.7-20.6), respectively.<br />CONCLUSION: Weight loss and mucosal nodularity were associated with ITB.

Acute abdominal symptomatology resulting from duodenal diverticula was as follows: one patient presented with perforation-diverticulitis, two patients with pancreatitis, one patient with acute acalculous cholecystitis, four patients with biliary dilation and two patients with acute postprandial discomfort-pain. The mean maximal diameter of the diverticula examined was 2.67 cm (range 0.96-4.98 cm). Further image analysis of the MDCT exams revealed that both the axial and the coronal plane demonstrated the presence of the diverticula but the depiction of the diverticular neck was demonstrated in five cases in the axial plane and in all cases in the coronal plane.<br />CONCLUSION: Although duodenal diverticula constitute a rare cause of acute abdomen, careful analysis of imaging studies can aid to the identification of this uncommon factor of abdominal symptomatology.","24713704","2011",\N

Case report].","Cirugia y cirujanos","BACKGROUND: during gestation, the urachus represents the connection between the dome of the bladder and the allantoic duct. This infection occurs preferentially in young adults, advocating the haematogenous or lymphatic pathway as possible routes of transmission, while a cord or bladder origin may also occur. Urachal cysts are rare in adult life, and is observed in only about 2% of adults.<br />CLINIC CASE: A 30-year-old male patient with a history of alcoholic hepatitis, diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic malnutrition, increased volume beginning with generalized abdominal pain, abdominal tumor of 20 by 15 cm, mobile, solid, without signs of peritoneal irritation. CT showed the presence of tumor, probably bladder-dependent, and apparently cystic. Exploratory laparotomy was found infected urachal cyst, draining 3,000 cc purulent material. A partial resection of the anterior face, keeping the back by firm adherence to bowel loops was done and is evolving satisfactorily.<br />DISCUSSION: urachal abnormalities are rare, with male / female ratio of 2 / 1. Although urachal abscess is an infection confined to an enclosed space, definitive treatment should not be the simple incision and drainage, because of the possibility of malignant transformation of urachal remnants. The definitive treatment should be considered complete excision of urachal cyst, when the infection is limited.<br />CONCLUSION: the urachus cyst is a rare pathology and is a diferencial diagnosis for acute appendicitis and it is necessary to know this treatment.","25063902",\N,\N
"944","Robotic-assisted laparoscopic reconstructive surgery in the lower urinary tract.","Current urology reports","Open surgery has long been the most common surgical approach for the correction of congenital anomalies of the lower urinary tract in children. With the continued development of minimally invasive surgery in adult urology, including endoscopic, conventional, and robot-assisted laparoscopic approaches, the indications for minimally invasive surgery have similarly expanded in the pediatric population. The most commonly performed robotic procedure in children has been pyeloplasty for ureteropelvic junction obstruction; the use of robotics in complex reconstructive surgery in the lower urinary tract has also been acceptable. In this review, we summarize recent viewpoints regarding robotic-assisted laparoscopic reconstructive surgeries in the lower urinary tract, such as ureteral reimplantation, appendicovesicostomy, and augmentation enterocystoplasty in the pediatric population, and critically summarize the current knowledge on outcomes in the literature. We also discuss our technique and the outcomes of robotic ureteral reimplantation. This review demonstrates that robotic-assisted laparoscopic reconstructive surgeries in the lower urinary tract are technically feasible and may achieve outcomes that are equalto those of open surgery, with reduced morbidity.","23740381","2013","8"
"945","Comprehensive target populations for current active safety systems using national crash databases.","Traffic injury prevention","OBJECTIVE: The objective of active safety systems is to prevent or mitigate collisions. A critical component in the design of active safety systems is the identification of the target population for a proposed system. The target population for an active safety system is that set of crashes that a proposed system could prevent or mitigate. Target crashes have scenarios in which the sensors and algorithms would likely activate. For example, the rear-end crash scenario, where the front of one vehicle contacts another vehicle traveling in the same direction and in the same lane as the striking vehicle, is one scenario for which forward collision warning (FCW) would be most effective in mitigating or preventing. This article presents a novel set of precrash scenarios based on coded variables from NHTSA's nationally representative crash databases in the United States.<br />METHODS: Using 4 databases (National Automotive Sampling System-General Estimates System [NASS-GES], NASS Crashworthiness Data System [NASS-CDS], Fatality Analysis Reporting System [FARS], and National Motor Vehicle Crash Causation Survey [NMVCCS]) the scenarios developed in this study can be used to quantify the number of police-reported crashes, seriously injured occupants, and fatalities that are applicable to proposed active safety systems. In this article, we use the precrash scenarios to identify the target populations for FCW, pedestrian crash avoidance systems (PCAS), lane departure warning (LDW), and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) or vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems. Crash scenarios were derived using precrash variables (critical event, accident type, precrash movement) present in all 4 data sources.<br />RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: This study found that these active safety systems could potentially mitigate approximately 1 in 5 of all severity and serious injury crashes in the United States and 26 percent of fatal crashes. Annually, this corresponds to 1.2 million all severity, 14,353 serious injury (MAIS 3+), and 7412 fatal crashes. In addition, we provide the source code for the crash scenarios as an appendix (see online supplement) to this article so that researchers can use the crash scenarios in future research.","24433115","2014",\N

It is most often asymptomatic but presenting symptoms are nonspecific and include abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, malabsorption, bleeding, obstruction, and/or perforation. A retrospective review of medical records between 1999 and 2012 at a tertiary referral center was conducted to identify patients requiring emergency management of complicated jejunal diverticulosis. Complications were defined as those that presented with inflammation, bleeding, obstruction, or perforation. Eighteen patients presented to the emergency department with acute complications of jejunal diverticulosis. Ages ranged from 47 to 86 years (mean, 72 years). Seven patients presented with evidence of free bowel perforation. Six had either diverticulitis or a contained perforation. The remaining five were found to have gastrointestinal bleeding. Fourteen of the patients underwent surgical management. Four patients were successfully managed nonoperatively. As a result of the variety of presentations, complications of jejunal diverticulosis present a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for the acute care surgeon. Although nonoperative management can be successful, most patients should undergo surgical intervention. Traditional management dictates laparotomy and segmental jejunal resection. Diverticulectomy is not recommended as a result of the risk of staple line breakdown. The entire involved portion of jejunum should be resected when bowel length permits.","24887799","2014","6"

Two hundred and thirty-five patients were seen in different hospitals, 88 of them the same night at the nearby emergency department. To evaluate long-term implications and to identify relevant indicators, a follow-up study was organized 1 year after the incident.<br />METHODS: Apart from the file data from the emergency departments, a 1-year follow-up mailing was sent to all patients.<br />RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-one patients returned their questionnaire (86%). The mean age of the patients was 28 years, with 61% men. The mean carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) was 9.9%. COHb levels were significantly higher for individuals on the ice (referee, players and maintenance personnel). There was a significant relationship with the initial presence of dizziness, fatigue and the COHb level. Headache, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting were not significantly related to the COHb levels. The relationship between symptoms and CO level, however, should be interpreted with caution as there was a wide range between exposure and blood tests. 5.2% of patients had residual complaints, all including headache, with a significant higher incidence with high COHb levels. Only two patients had an abnormal neurological control (one slightly disturbed electroencephalography and one persistent encephalopathic complaint). Work incapacity was also significantly related to COHb levels.<br />CONCLUSION: CO mass poisonings remain a risk in indoor sporting events. Although it causes an acute mass casualty incident, it is limited in time and delayed problems are scarce. Symptomatology is a poor tool for triage. The best prevention is the use of nonmineral energy sources such as for example electricity.","23274717","2013","12"

"949","Pigment epithelium-derived factor decreases outflow facility.","Investigative ophthalmology & visual science","PURPOSE: Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) regulates blood-retinal barrier function. As a constituent of aqueous humor, the role of PEDF in conventional outflow function is unknown. The goals of the study were to examine the effects of PEDF on barrier function of cultured Schlemm's canal (SC) endothelia and outflow facility in mouse eyes in situ.<br />METHODS: To model the inner wall of SC, transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) of human SC and porcine angular aqueous plexus (AAP) cells was monitored. To examine an intact conventional outflow pathway, enucleated eyes from culled C57BL/6 mice were perfused with PEDF using a computer-controlled system. Purified PEDF (0.1 and 1 Î¼g/mL) was perfused at four different pressure steps (4, 8, 15, 20 mm Hg), measuring flow to determine outflow facility (slope of flow/pressure relationship).<br />RESULTS: Pigment epithelium-derived factor increased TEER of porcine AAP cells in a dose-dependent fashion (0.3-3 Î¼g/mL), and 1 Î¼g/mL recombinant PEDF or conditioned media from pigmented retinal pigment epithelial monolayers stabilized TEER of human SC monolayers over time (0-48 hours). In perfusion experiments, we observed a 43.7% decrease in outflow facility (0.016 vs. 0.029 Î¼L/min/mm Hg, P = 4.5 Ã— 10â»âµ) in eyes treated with 1 Î¼g/mL PEDF compared to vehicle-perfused controls, and a 19.9% decrease (0.021 vs. 0.027 Î¼L/min/mm Hg, P = 0.003) at 100 ng/mL PEDF.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Pigment epithelium-derived factor increased barrier function in both the in vitro and in situ models of the inner wall of SC. Modification of PEDF signaling in SC cells may be therapeutically exploited to increase outflow facility in people with ocular hypertension or decrease outflow facility in those with hypotony.","24030458","2013","10"

In a prospective study, the feasibility of 18F-MK-9470 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in patients with primary and metastatic PCa was evaluated.<br />METHODS: Eight patients were included and underwent 18F-MK-9470 PET/CT imaging. For five patients with primary PCa, dynamic PET/CT imaging was performed over three acquisition intervals (0 to 30, 60 to 90 and 120 to 150 min post-injection). In malignant and benign prostate tissue regions, time activity curves of the mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean) were determined as well as the corresponding area under the curve to compare 18F-MK-9470 uptake over time. Muscle uptake of 18F-MK-9470 was used as reference for non-specific binding. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used as anatomical reference and for delineating intraprostatic tumours. Histological and immunohistochemical (IHC) examination was performed on the whole-mount histopathology sections of four patients who underwent radical prostatectomy to assess the MRI-based tumour versus benign tissue classification. For three patients with proven advanced metastatic disease, two static PET/CTs were performed 1 and 3 h post-injection. 18F-MK-9470 uptake was evaluated in bone lesions of metastatic PCa by comparing SUVmean values of metastases with these of the contralateral bone tissue.<br />RESULTS: 18F-MK-9470 uptake was significantly higher in benign and malignant prostate tissue compared to muscle, but it did not differ between both prostate tissue compartments. IHC findings of corresponding prostatic histopathological sections indicated weak CB1R expression in locally confined PCa, which was not visualized with 18F-MK-9470 PET. Metastases in the axial skeleton could not be detected while some metastases in the appendicular skeleton showed higher 18F-MK-9470 uptake as compared to the uptake in contralateral normal bone.<br />CONCLUSIONS: 18F-MK-9470 PET could not detect local PCa or bone metastases in the axial skeleton but was able to visualize metastases in the appendicular skeleton.

A protocol was developed for performing this procedure in an Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC) with extended recovery.<br />METHODS: From January 2000 to December 2011, data about all laparoscopic incisional hernia repairs were gathered prospectively. The patients' clinical features, hernia type, intraoperative and postoperative complications and reasons for hospital admission are studied.<br />RESULTS: A total of 259 patients have been operated for incisional hernia (185) or recurrent hernioplasty (74) in our ASC. Laparoscopic repair was successful in 254 patients (98.07Â %). Conversion to open surgery was necessary in five patients (1.93Â %). A total of 50 patients (19.69Â %) in whom surgery was completed laparoscopically were discharged the same day of surgery, 179 (70.47Â %) at 24Â h and 25 (9.84Â %) required a stay of over 24Â h. Postoperative pain was severe in 10Â % of patients, moderate in 40Â %, and mild in 50Â %. Complications, mostly minor and self-limiting, were observed in 25 patients (9.84Â %) during hospital stay. Five major complications that occured were: bile peritonitis, an acute peritonitis, due to an inadvertent intestinal perforation, and one intestinal obstruction by partial detachment of the mesh, an intra-abdominal hematoma and a colo-cutaneous fistula. There were no deaths in the series. The mean follow-up of patients was 29.35Â months (range 12-129Â months). The recurrence rate was 7.03Â % (nÂ =Â 18). Four trocar-site hernias were detected.<br />CONCLUSIONS: It is essential to create a protocol with selection criteria that take into account the patient, his entourage, the anesthetic-surgical procedure, and a team dedicated to surgical laparoscopic surgery in an ASC with extended recovery to achieve good results in terms of morbidity and patient safety.","24609586","2014","3"
"952","Procollagen type III N-terminal peptide (P3NP) and lean mass: a cross-sectional study.","The Journal of frailty & aging","BACKGROUND: Procollagen type III N-terminal peptide (P3NP) is released during collagen synthesis in muscle. Increased circulating P3NP is a marker not only of muscle growth, but also of muscle repair and fibrosis. Thus, P3NP may be a potential biomarker for sarcopenia.<br />OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between plasma P3NP and lean mass and strength.<br />DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional study of men and women from the Framingham Offspring Study. Participants included a convenience sample of 687 members with a measure of plasma P3NP and lean mass, and 806 members with P3NP and quadriceps strength assessment.<br />MEASUREMENTS: Linear regression was used to estimate the association between total and appendicular lean mass and plasma P3NP, and quadriceps strength and P3NP.<br />RESULTS: Mean age was 58 years. Median plasma P3NP was similar in men (3.4 mg/L), premenopausal women (3.1 mg/L), and postmenopausal women (3.0 mg/L). In adjusted models, higher P3NP was associated with a modest decrease in total and appendicular lean mass in postmenopausal women [Î²= -0.13 unit P3NP/kg total lean mass; p=0.003]. A similar trend was found among premenopausal women, although results were not statistically significant [Î²=-0.10 unit P3NP/kg total lean mass; p=0.41]. No association between P3NP and lean mass was observed in men. P3NP was not associated with strength in men or women.<br />CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that plasma P3NP might be a useful biomarker of muscle mass in postmenopausal women if longitudinal studies demonstrate that it has adequate sensitivity and specificity to predict muscle loss.","24244927","2013",\N
"953","Role of the transumbilical laparoscopic-assisted single-channel, single-port procedure in an interval appendectomy for pediatric mass-forming appendicitis: a preliminary retrospective analysis.","Asian journal of endoscopic surgery","INTRODUCTION: A transumbilical laparoscopic-assisted single-channel, single-port procedure was introduced during laparoscopic interval appendectomy for mass-forming appendicitis in children. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of the original laparoscopic interval appendectomy.<br />METHODS: This study analyzed 31 children who underwent laparoscopic interval appendectomy using a single-channel, single-port procedure. The appendectomy was usually planned 8-12 weeks following initial conservative treatment. The procedure was a single-channel surgery using a 12-mm single port. Both a 5-mm telescope and grasper were inserted simultaneously into the single channel. The grasper held the appendix, and an extracorporeal appendectomy was performed.<br />RESULTS: Appendectomy was planned for 29 patients, as 2 patients deviated from the protocol. The procedure was successful in 21 patients (72.4%). An accessory port was necessary in eight patients, two of whom successfully underwent laparoscopic surgery; the remaining six were converted to open appendectomy. The average length of surgery was 43â€‰min in the single-channel, single-port procedure. No postoperative complications occurred in any patient.<br />CONCLUSION: The single-channel, single-port procedure was successfully performed in over 70% of the patients. This preliminary retrospective analysis indicates that the procedure is safe and potentially beneficial in children with mass-forming appendicitis who require laparoscopic interval appendectomy.","24861142","2014","8"
"954","[A paradigm shift in pediatric surgery created by the National Clinical Database].","Nihon Geka Gakkai zasshi","The use of data from the National Clinical Database (NCD) is becoming more important in pediatric surgery. First, it is possible to review all surgical data in the NCD. Although pediatric surgeons treat a wide variety of conditions, with the exceptions of common ones such as appendicitis or inguinal hernia, rare anomalies with an incidence of only one in 1,000 births account for most cases. Therefore the number of surgeries for each type of rare anomaly performed in institutions specializing in pediatric surgery annually is very few. If many institutions do not accumulate large numbers of cases over the short-term, it will be impossible to analyze useful surgical data. The use of NCD data can therefore contribute to safe, clear medical care. Second, the Japanese neonate/infant mortality rate is the world's lowest, but on the other hand, the mortality rate of 1-3-year-olds is around the 20th lowest. The leading cause of death in this age-group is accident, and therefore the development of a childhood emergency medical system is important to improve this situation. Pediatric surgeons have an important role to play in emergency care and only they can prevent complications from surgery. However, until the creation of the NCD it was not clear which types of medical care were given at which institutions. Analysis of the reasonable placement of specialists or the ideal system of pediatric surgical emergency care can now be conducted based on scientific grounds by analyzing data from the NCD provided by all surgeons. For those performing pediatric surgery, the true value of the NCD will be determined in the future based on how they cope with this paradigm shift.","24597331","2014","1"
"955","Is current surgical training efficient? A national survey.","Journal of surgical education","OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of surgical training in Denmark is competency based with no requirement for a specific number of procedures. This may affect monitoring of surgical progress adversely and cause an underestimation of the time needed to acquire surgical competencies. We investigated the number of common surgical procedures performed by trainees. Trainees' and consultants' expectations from the training program were also investigated.<br />DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: A questionnaire was sent to all 115 surgical trainees in Denmark. We asked how many common surgical procedures the trainees had performed during their postgraduate training, whether self-reported procedural confidence was achieved during their training, and whether their training expectations were met. Another questionnaire dealt with the consultants' expectations of the surgical training.<br />RESULTS: The total number of common surgical procedures (Lichtenstein hernia repair, appendectomy, laparoscopic appendectomy, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy) that were performed varied between trainees. One group performed few common procedures during training. A low number in 1 procedure correlated with a similar pattern in other procedures. Approximately one-third did not perform common elective procedures independently until their fifth year. Consultants and trainees viewed training differently.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals no common trend in the numbers and types of procedures performed during training. The number of procedures seems to reflect the individual trainee and a local tradition rather than the particular training program. An informal competency-based assessment system with lack of quantitative requirements evidently involves a risk of skewness in training.","24797853",\N,\N

Temsirolimus had been initiated three weeks previously in an attempt to control retroperitoneal metastases of uterine leiomyosarcoma, which had progressed despite surgical resection, six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy, and pelvic irradiation. A computed tomography scan revealed a large pelvic mass with foci of gas, fluid collection, and other findings highly suggestive of an abscess due to bowel perforation. Application of the adverse drug reaction probability scale of Naranjo et al. in this case indicated a probable relationship between the bowel perforation and temsirolimus use; a literature search identified no other reported cases of temsirolimus-associated bowel perforation in association with uterine leiomyosarcoma. It is suspected that the patient's recent course of pelvic radiotherapy may have played a role in predisposing her to bowel perforation during temsirolimus use. While the mechanism of bowel perforations associated with temsirolimus therapy remains unclear, it is possible that due to its inhibitory effects on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), temsirolimus use may result in gastrointestinal stresses and weaknesses similar to those attributed to bevacizumab, a VEGF-targeted angiogenesis inhibitor that has been linked to chemotherapy-induced bowel perforation.<br />CONCLUSION: A woman who recently received pelvic radiation experienced a bowel perforation after three infusions of temsirolimus for the treatment of metastatic leiomyosarcoma.","24830996","2014","6"

Anecdotal evidence suggests there are worse outcomes in this population after common operative procedures like appendectomy. ThisÂ study aims to classify whether there are relevant disparities in postoperative outcomes in CP versus non-CP patients after open or laparoscopic appendectomy.<br />METHODS: Hospital discharge data from the 2003-2009 weighted Nationwide Inpatient Sample were used. Unadjusted and adjusted multiple logistic regression were used to assess postoperative complications, as well as inpatient mortality, average duration of hospital stay, and cost.<br />RESULTS: Approximately 1,250 patients with CP met the inclusion criteria. After adjusted analysis, CP patients displayed significantly greater odds of the following postoperative complications: Sepsis/organ failure, operation-related infection, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Patients with CP also had a greater cost and in-hospital stay after appendectomy.<br />CONCLUSION: Patients with CP have greater adjusted odds of complications after open or laparoscopic appendectomy. The mechanisms that led to these disparities need to be studied and may include difficulties in patient assessment and communication. Additional education of healthcare providers to improve recognition of symptoms and care for patients with disabilities may be more immediately helpful in decreasing disparities in outcomes.","23972654","2013","9"

Personal experience and review of the literature.","Minerva pediatrica","AIM: It has been speculated that Single Incision Paediatric Endoscopic Surgery (SIPES) in children could result in more postoperative pain given the device size for a child umbilicus. Herein, we compare the postoperative pain in children who underwent SIPES or standard laparoscopy (SL).<br />METHODS: Patients who underwent SIPES via Olympus TriPortâ„¢ Access system between 2010 and 2011 were prospectively compared with SL controls (similar age, sex and type of operation). Primary endpoint was analgesic requirement (number of doses and dose/kg). A systematic review of the literature included all articles (2008-2012) comparing postoperative pain following transumbilical SIPES and SL in children. Data were analysed using non--parametric tests.<br />RESULTS: 10 patients (8 males, median age 9 years, range 4--15) underwent 11 SIPES procedures: appendicectomy (n=6), orchidopexy (n=2), cholecystectomy (n=2), and total colectomy (n=1). There was no difference in Paracetamol requirement between SIPES (median 74 mg/kg, range 14--149) and SL (median 59 mg/Kg, range 13--108, P=0.76) patients. Morphine was required by only two patients per group (no difference in dosage or frequency). Eight studies (2010-2012) comparing 334 SIPES vs. 343 SL patients were analysed. Three studies showed advantage of SIPES, and four no difference between SIPES and SL. One randomised trial reported greater pain in SIPES appendicectomy, but no difference with SL once patients were discharged home.<br />CONCLUSION: SIPES does not seem to be associated with more postoperative pain than SL in children. In appropriate cases, SIPES is a valid alternative to SL for a good range of paediatric procedures.","25034218","2014","7"

We investigated the contribution of these processes to the diversification of Pericallis, a genus endemic to Macaronesia.<br />METHODS: Data from the chloroplast psaI-accD and trnV-ndhC regions and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) were sampled for multiple accessions of all taxa and used to establish phylogenetic hypotheses. Habitat preferences were optimized to investigate habitat shifts, and divergence times were estimated. Species nonmonophyly was investigated using Bayes factors.<br />KEY RESULTS: Much of the diversification in Pericallis has occurred recently, within the past 1.7 Ma. Three habitat shifts have occurred in the evolution of the genus. However, geographic isolation has played a greater role in its diversification. Novel allopatric patterns were revealed within some species, highlighting the significance of geographic isolation in the evolution of Pericallis. One species (P. appendiculata) that resolved as monophyletic in the ITS analysis was polyphyletic in the chloroplast analysis. Bayes factors provide strong support for the nonmonophyly of P. appendiculata haplotypes, and their phylogenetic placement suggests that ancient hybridization is responsible for the haplotype diversity observed.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Multiple markers and extensive sampling provided new insights into the evolution of Pericallis. In contrast to previous studies, our results reveal a more significant role for allopatry than habitat shifts and new evidence for ancient hybridization in the evolution of Pericallis. Our study highlights the power of broad taxon sampling for unraveling diversity patterns and processes within oceanic island radiations.","24658278","2014","4"

Most of the clinicians are not aware of the pathology and less evidence is available regarding the optimal treatment of this less common form of cholecystitis in the present era of laparoscopic surgery.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary care university hospital from 1989 to 2009. Histopathologically confirmed XGC study patients (N=27) were compared with non-Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (NXGC) control group (N=27). The outcomes variables were operative time, complication rate and laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy conversion rate. The study group (XGC) was further divided in to three sub groups; group I open cholecystectomy (OC), laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and laparoscopic converted to open cholecystectomy (LCO) for comparative analysis to identify the significant variables.<br />RESULTS: During the study period 6878 underwent cholecystectomy including open cholecystectomy in 2309 and laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 4569 patients. Histopathology confirmed xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis in 30 patients (0.43% of all cholecystectomies) and 27 patients qualified for the inclusion criterion. Gallbladder carcinoma was reported in 100 patients (1.45%) during the study period and no association was found with XGC. The mean age of patients with XGC was 49.8 year (range: 29-79), with male to female ratio of 1:3. The most common clinical features were abdominal pain and tenderness in right hypochondrium. Biliary colic and acute cholecystitis were the most common preoperative diagnosis. Ultrasonogram was performed in all patients and CT scan abdomen in 5 patients. In study population (XGC), 10 were patients in group I, 8 in group II and 9 in group III. Conversion rate from laparoscopy to open was 53 % (n=9), surgical site infection rate of 14.8% (n=4) and common bile duct injury occurred one patient in open cholecystectomy group (3.7%). Statistically significant differences between group I and group II were raised total leukocyte count: 10.6Â±3.05 vs. 7.05Â±1.8 (P-Value 0.02) and duration of surgery in minutes: 248.75Â±165 vs. 109Â±39.7 (P-Value 0.04). The differences between group III and group II were duration of surgery in minutes: 208.75Â±58 vs. 109Â±39.7 (P-Value 0.03) and duration of symptoms in days: 3Â±1.8 vs. 9.8Â±8.8 (P-Value 0.04). The mean hospital stay in group I was 9.7 days, group II 5.6 days and in group III 10.5 days. Two patients underwent extended cholecystectomy based on clinical suspicion of carcinoma. No mortality was observed in this study population. Duration of surgery was higher in XGC group as compared to controls (NXGC) (203Â±129 vs.128Â±4, p-value=0.008) and no statistically significant difference in incidence proportion of operative complication rate were observed among the group (25.9% vs. 14.8%, p-value=0.25. Laparoscopic surgery was introduced in 1994 and 17 patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy and higher conversion rate from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy was observed in 17 study group (XGC) as compared to 27 Control group (NXGC) 53%vs.3.3% with P-value of < 0.023.<br />CONCLUSION: XGC is a rare entity of cholecystitis and preoperative diagnosis is a challenging task. Difficult dissection was encountered in open as well in laparoscopic cholecystectomy with increased operation time. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was carried out with high conversion rate to improve the safety of procedure. Per operative clinical suspicion of malignancy was high but no association of XGC was found with gallbladder carcinoma, therefore frozen section is recommended before embarking on radical surgery.","24019688","2013","7"

Given that abdominal hernias are a frequent imaging finding, radiologists not only are required to interpret the appearances of abdominal hernias but also should be comfortable with identifying associated complications and postrepair findings. 2. CT is the imaging modality of choice for the assessment of a known adult abdominal hernia in both elective and acute circumstances because of rapid acquisition, capability of multiplanar reconstruction, good spatial resolution, and anatomic depiction with excellent sensitivity for most complications. 3. Ultrasound is useful for adult groin assessment and is the imaging modality of choice for pediatric abdominal wall hernia assessment, whereas MRI is beneficial when there is reasonable concern that a patient's symptoms could be attributable to a hernia or a musculoskeletal source. 4. Fluoroscopic herniography is a sensitive radiologic investigation for patients with groin pain in whom a hernia is suspected but in whom a hernia cannot be identified at physical examination. 5. The diagnosis of an internal hernia not only is a challenging clinical diagnosis but also can be difficult to diagnose with imaging: Closed-loop small-bowel obstruction and abnormally located bowel loops relative to normally located small bowel or colon should prompt assessment for an internal hernia.","24848843","2014","6"

Angioedema in the respiratorytract maycause airway obstruction; severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea may occur in the GI tract. Patients with HAE may be diagnosed and managed by HAE specialists or by primary care physicians depending on individual circumstances. Proper treatment requires differentiation from other forms of angioedema. Patients with HAE who are managed appropriately with medications that treat and prevent atttacks may have a lower risk of death from laryngeal edema and a better quality of life.

We report here a case developing right and left intrahepatic pseudocyst following acute biliary pancreatitis. Ultrasound and computed tomography scan revealed a 13-cm right and two 4-cm left intrahepatic collections. Percutaneous puncture permitted us to detect a high level of amylase in the collection, confirming the diagnosis of intrahepatic pseudocyst. Percutaneous drainage resulted in 3000 mL of fluid discharge. The mechanism involved in this patient was rupture of the pancreatic pseudocyst in the retroperitoneal cavity and erosion reaching the right hepatic parenchyma retroperitoneally posterior to the hepatoduodenal ligament and the left hepatic parenchyma via the hepatogastric ligament. Besides, endoscopic sphincterotomy was performed with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for cholangitis. After performing endoscopic sphincterotomy, the cysts in the left lobe resolved dramatically. Intrahepatic pseudocyst should be kept in mind when an intrahepatic collection is found in a patients with chronic or recent episode of acute pancreatitis. Computed tomography and high level of amylase in the collection plays an important role for diagnosing this complication.

In the literature, few cases in pregnancy have been previously published. Tuberculous peritonitis in pregnancy is a diagnostic challenge, especially in the absence of lung involvement. It mimics other diseases and clinical presentation is usually non-specific, which may lead to diagnostic delay and development of complications.<br />CASE PRESENTATION: We report here a new case of tuberculous peritonitis that occurred in a 31-year-old Caucasian pregnant woman at 22 weeks' gestation. She was complaining of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. These symptoms appeared 6 months prior to presentation. Initially, they were attributed to pregnancy, but they progressively became more severe during subsequent weeks. A laparoscopy showed the presence of yellow-white nodules on the peritoneal surface and a biopsy demonstrated caseous necrotic granuloma. She made a good physical recovery after being placed on antituberculous chemotherapy and gave birth to a healthy male neonate of 3100g at 37 weeks' gestation by vaginal delivery.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Extreme vigilance should be used when dealing with unexplained abdominal symptoms to ensure timely diagnosis of tuberculous peritonitis. Diagnosis often requires a histopathological examination. In these patients early diagnosis with early antituberculous therapy are essential to prevent obstetrical and neonatal morbidity.","24382008","2014",\N

Data was extracted from eligible studies to evaluate the pooled outcome effects for the total of 1068 patients. The meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.2.0. For dichotomous data and continuous data, the risk ratio (RR) and the mean difference (MD) were calculated, respectively, with 95%CI for both. For continuous outcomes with different measurement scales in different RCTs, the standardized mean difference (SMD) was calculated with 95%CI. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed when necessary.<br />RESULTS: Six RCTs were identified that compared SILA (n = 535) with CLA (n = 533). Five RCTs had a high risk of bias and one RCT had a low risk of bias. SILA was associated with longer operative time (MD = 5.68, 95%CI: 3.91-7.46, P < 0.00001), higher conversion rate (RR = 5.14, 95%CI: 1.25-21.10, P = 0.03) and better cosmetic satisfaction score (MD = 0.52, 95%CI: 0.30-0.73, P < 0.00001) compared with CLA. No significant differences were found for total complications (RR = 1.15, 95%CI: 0.76-1.75, P = 0.51), drain insertion (RR = 0.72, 95%CI: 0.41-1.25, P = 0.24), or length of hospital stay (SMD = 0.04, 95%CI: -0.08-0.16, P = 0.57). Because there was not enough data among the analyzed RCTs, postoperative pain was not calculated.<br />CONCLUSION: The benefit of SILA is cosmetic satisfaction, while the disadvantages of SILA are longer operative time and higher conversion rate.","23964153","2013","8"
"977","Human case of fasciolosis in Serbia treated with triclabendazole.","Vojnosanitetski pregled. Military-medical and pharmaceutical review","INTRODUCTION: The number of humans infected by Fasciola hepatica is increasing worldwide. Humans can become accidental hosts by ingesting drinking water or plants contaminated with metacercariae.<br />CASE REPORT: We reported a case of a 68-year-old Serbian woman, in which the diagnosis of acute fasciolosis had been established after serious diagnostic concerns. Based on clinical picture (episodic right upper quadrant abdominal pain, febrility and generalized body pain) and biochemical analyses (high eosinophilia and high activity of alkaline phosphatase), she was appointed as suspected to the acute fasciolosis. Stool and duodenal aspirate exams were negative for Fasciola ova. In the absence of adequate serologic diagnostic for fasciolosis in Serbia, the diagnosis was confirmed using enzyme immunoassays and immunoblot at the Institute for Tropical Diseases in Hamburg, Germany. Soon after triclabendazole was administered, the symptoms disappeared and biochemical values returned to normal.<br />CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of human fasciolosis may be problematic and delayed, especially in non endemic areas, because physicians rarely encounter this disease and a long list of other diseases must be considered in the differential diagnosis. The syndrome of eosinophilia, fever, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain suggest acute fasciolosis. Unclear source does not rule out fasciolosis.","24665580","2014","2"

Many secondary metabolites of agarwood are known to have medicinal value to humans, including compounds that have been shown to elicit sedative effects and exhibit anti-cancer properties. However, little is known about the genome, transcriptome, and the biosynthetic pathways responsible for producing such secondary metabolites in agarwood.<br />RESULTS: In this study, we present a draft genome and a putative pathway for cucurbitacin E and I, compounds with known medicinal value, from in vitro Aquilaria agallocha agarwood. DNA and RNA data are utilized to annotate many genes and protein functions in the draft genome. The expression changes for cucurbitacin E and I are shown to be consistent with known responses of A. agallocha to biotic stress and a set of homologous genes in Arabidopsis thaliana related to cucurbitacin bio-synthesis is presented and validated through qRT-PCR.<br />CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first attempt to identify cucurbitacin E and I from in vitro agarwood and the first draft genome for any species of Aquilaria. The results of this study will aid in future investigations of secondary metabolite pathways in Aquilaria and other non-model medicinal plants.","25005802","2014",\N

Although the vast majority of intervention studies involve multiple outcome measures, few studies use multivariate analysis methods. The authors discuss multivariate extensions to the multilevel model that can be used by psychotherapy researchers.<br />METHOD AND RESULTS: Using simulated longitudinal treatment data, the authors show how multivariate models extend common univariate growth models and how the multivariate model can be used to examine multivariate hypotheses involving fixed effects (e.g., does the size of the treatment effect differ across outcomes?) and random effects (e.g., is change in one outcome related to change in the other?). An online supplemental appendix provides annotated computer code and simulated example data for implementing a multivariate model.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Multivariate multilevel models are flexible, powerful models that can enhance clinical research.","24491071","2014","10"

Primarily to assess the range of pathology, the presenting features, and the surgical management of these lesions.<br />METHODS: A search of the hospital surgical pathology database was carried out to identify patients less than 16 years in whom ovarian tissue was submitted for pathological analysis during the 12 year period from January 2000 to December 2011. A retrospective review of the medical records was carried out.<br />RESULTS: 244 ovarian masses in 219 patients were identified. 99 of these were neoplastic with 19 (7.8%) being malignant and an additional four (1.6%) borderline malignant lesions (borderline epithelial tumours). Mature cystic teratoma was the commonest neoplastic lesion (55.6%). Patients who presented with acute abdominal pain were more commonly found to have non-neoplastic lesions than neoplastic lesions (71.5% vs 46.9%, p<0.0001), and those that presented with a palpable mass were more commonly found to have a neoplastic lesion (24.0% vs 3.3%, p<0.0001). Laparoscopic surgery was performed in 41.6% of all patients. Ovary conserving surgery was performed in 56.6% of all patients, though only 32.3% of patients with neoplastic lesions.<br />CONCLUSION: This study provides important insight into the range of ovarian pathology encountered in a New Zealand paediatric population. Most of the ovarian lesions in paediatric age groups are benign. Ovarian sparing surgery is recommended. In cases of ovarian torsion, malignancy in this series and in the literature is less than 2%.

The case report involves a 58-year-old woman with significant cardiac history and hereditary blood disorder who came in complaining of abdominal pain and coffee-ground emesis for two days. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed segmental wall thickening of the proximal jejunum with hyperdense, heterogenous luminal content. Similar findings were evident in the left lower small bowel region, suspicious for small bowel hematoma and the possibility of intraluminal clots. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed post resuscitation showed punctate, erythematous lesions throughout the stomach as well as regions of small bowel mucosa that appeared scalloped, ulcerated, and hemorrhaged on contact. Despite initial treatment for immunostain-positive focal cytomegalovirus gastritis, follow-up esophagogastroduodenoscopy after two months continued to demonstrate friable and irregular duodenal mucosa hinting at a different underlying etiology. Pathology reports from analyses of biopsy samples highlighted infiltration and expansion of the lamina propria and submucosa. Subsequent staining with congo red/crystal violet and appropriate subtyping established the diagnosis of AL (kappa)-type amyloidosis. The significance of this case lies in the fact that our patient did not have the typically seen diagnostic systemic involvements-namely of heart and kidneys-usually seen in primary (AL) amyloidosis patients. It was the persistent endoscopic findings and biopsy results which gave clues to the physicians regarding the possibility of an abnormal protein-deposition entity.","24748922","2014","4"

Nephropathia epidemica (NE), caused by PUUV, is characterized by acute renal injury (AKI) with thrombocytopenia and frequently gastrointestinal symptoms.<br />METHODS: 456 patients with serologically and clinically confirmed NE were investigated at time of follow-up in a single clinic. The course of the NE was investigated using medical reports. We identified patients who had endoscopy with intestinal biopsy during acute phase of NE. Histopathological, immunohistochemical and molecular analyses of the biopsies were performed.<br />RESULTS: Thirteen patients underwent colonoscopy or gastroscopy for abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting during acute phase of NE. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed PUUV nucleocapsid antigen in 11 biopsies from 8 patients; 14 biopsies from 5 patients were negative for PUUV nucleocapsid antigen. IHC localized PUUV nucleocapsid antigen in endothelial cells of capillaries or larger vessels in the lamina propria. Rate of AKI was not higher and severity of AKI was not different in the PUUV-positive compared to the PUUV-negative group. All IHC positive biopsies were positive for PUUV RNA using RT-PCR. Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed clustering of all PUUV strains from this study with viruses previously detected from the South-West of Germany. Long-term outcome was favorable in both groups.<br />CONCLUSIONS: In patients with NE, PUUV nucleocapsid antigen and PUUV RNA was detected frequently in the intestine. This finding could explain frequent GI-symptoms in NE patients, thus demonstration of a more generalized PUUV infection. The RT-PCR was an effective and sensitive method to detect PUUV RNA in FFPE tissues. Therefore, it can be used as a diagnostic and phylogenetic approach also for archival materials. AKI was not more often present in patients with PUUV-positive IHC. This last finding should be investigated in larger numbers of patients with PUUV infection.","24857988","2014",\N

GNAS mutations (p.R201H, c.602G>A and p.R201C, and c.602C>T) were identified in 17 (31%) of 55 of disseminated mucinous neoplasms and were found in 8 (35%) of 23 low-grade mucinous neoplasms, 7 (37%) of 19 high-grade mucinous adenocarcinomas lacking a signet ring cell component, and 2 (15%) of 13 high-grade mucinous adenocarcinomas with a signet ring cell component. All 7 mucinous adenocarcinomas composed of pure (>95%) signet ring cells harbored wild-type GNAS. There was no significant association between GNAS mutations and sex and age (both with P > .05) or between GNAS mutations and individual adverse histologic features including cytologic grade, destructive invasion, tumor cellularity, angiolymphatic invasion, perineural invasion, and signet ring cells (all with P > .05). KRAS mutations were identified in 22 (40%) of 55 disseminated mucinous neoplasms. GNAS-mutated disseminated appendiceal mucinous neoplasms more frequently harbored concurrent KRAS mutations compared with GNAS wild-type tumors (65% versus 29%, P = .018). GNAS mutations were not significantly associated with overall survival (both with P > .05). Only overall tumor grade was an independent predictor of overall survival in the multivariate analysis (P = .01). Our results indicate that GNAS mutations are frequently identified in both low-grade and high-grade disseminated appendiceal mucinous neoplasms indicating that GNAS mutation status cannot be used to distinguish between low-grade from high-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms.","24925222","2014","8"
"994","NTP Monograph: Health Effects of Low-Level Lead.","NTP monograph","Although reductions in lead (Pb) exposure for the U.S. population have resulted in lower blood Pb levels over time, epidemiological studies continue to provide evidence of health effects at lower and lower blood Pb levels. Low-level Pb was selected for evaluation by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) because of (1) the availability of a large number of epidemiological studies of Pb, (2) a nomination by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health for an assessment of Pb at lower levels of exposure, and (3) public concern for effects of Pb in children and adults. This evaluation summarizes the evidence in humans and presents conclusions on health effects in children and adults associated with low-level Pb exposure as indicated by less than 10 micrograms of Pb per deciliter of blood (less than 10 micrograms/dL). The assessment focuses on epidemiological evidence at blood Pb levels less than 10 micrograms/dL and less than 5 micrograms/dL because health effects at higher blood Pb levels are well established. The NTP evaluation was conducted through the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT, formerly the Center for the Evaluation of Risks to Human Reproduction) and completed in April of 2012. The results of this evaluation are published in the NTP Monograph on Health Effects of Low-Level Lead. The document and appendices are available at http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/go/evals. This document provides background on Pb exposure and includes a review of the primary epidemiological literature for evidence that low-level Pb is associated with neurological, immunological, cardiovascular, renal, and/or reproductive and developmental effects. The NTP Monograph presents specific conclusions for each health effect area. Overall, the NTP concludes that there is sufficient evidence that blood Pb levels less than 10 micrograms/dL and less than 5 micrograms/dL are associated with adverse health effects in children and adults. This conclusion was based on a review of the primary epidemiological literature, scientific input from technical advisors that reviewed pre-public release drafts of each chapter summarizing the evidence for specific health effects associated with low-level Pb, public comments received during the course of the evaluation, and comments from an expert panel of ad hoc reviewers during a public meeting to review the Draft NTP Monograph on November 17-18, 2011 (http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/go/37090).","24743654","2012","6"

A phase 2 trial suggested that treatment with 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily reduced lung-function decline and acute exacerbations in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.<br />METHODS: We conducted two replicate 52-week, randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trials (INPULSIS-1 and INPULSIS-2) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily as compared with placebo in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The primary end point was the annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC). Key secondary end points were the time to the first acute exacerbation and the change from baseline in the total score on the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, both assessed over a 52-week period.<br />RESULTS: A total of 1066 patients were randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to receive nintedanib or placebo. The adjusted annual rate of change in FVC was -114.7 ml with nintedanib versus -239.9 ml with placebo (difference, 125.3 ml; 95% confidence interval [CI], 77.7 to 172.8; P<0.001) in INPULSIS-1 and -113.6 ml with nintedanib versus -207.3 ml with placebo (difference, 93.7 ml; 95% CI, 44.8 to 142.7; P<0.001) in INPULSIS-2. In INPULSIS-1, there was no significant difference between the nintedanib and placebo groups in the time to the first acute exacerbation (hazard ratio with nintedanib, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.54 to 2.42; P=0.67); in INPULSIS-2, there was a significant benefit with nintedanib versus placebo (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.77; P=0.005). The most frequent adverse event in the nintedanib groups was diarrhea, with rates of 61.5% and 18.6% in the nintedanib and placebo groups, respectively, in INPULSIS-1 and 63.2% and 18.3% in the two groups, respectively, in INPULSIS-2.<br />CONCLUSIONS: In patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, nintedanib reduced the decline in FVC, which is consistent with a slowing of disease progression; nintedanib was frequently associated with diarrhea, which led to discontinuation of the study medication in less than 5% of patients.

Drug-induced pancreatitis (DIP) is rare and has been associated with acetaminophen.<br />CASE: A 19-year-old female presents with a one-week history of abdominal pain associated with nausea, vomiting, and headache. One day earlier she was discharged from an outside hospital where she was admitted for fulminant hepatic failure secondary to acetaminophen toxicity. She had no other complaints and denied consuming alcohol or taking any medications. An examination showed epigastric tenderness. Labs obtained on admission revealed abnormal but improving liver function tests with worsening amylase and lipase. A computed tomography scan on day three of admission revealed what appeared to be a large pancreatic pseudocyst. A magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatographyconfirmed the diagnosis.<br />DISCUSSION: Here we present the case of a young female with a delayed onset acetaminophen-induced pancreatitis. Although DIP is rare, acetaminophen should be recognized as a cause of acute pancreatitis. In addition, itis important for physicians to recognize the increased incidence of pancreatic pseudocyst amongst patients under age 20 with history of DIP, and include pseudocyst in the differential and workup for those presenting with recurrent abdominal pain.","24600780","2014","1"
"1000","Acute appendicitis complicated by mass formation occurring simultaneously with serologically proven dengue fever: a case report.","Journal of medical case reports","INTRODUCTION: Acute abdomen and acute appendicitis are unusual clinical presentations that occur in dengue infection-caused illness. Lymphoid hyperplasia and mesenteric adenitis are possible explanations, although vasculitis in the pathology of dengue infection has not been reported. Authors of previous case reports have described mimicking of acute appendicitis discovered upon surgical treatment. Dengue virus has not been proven to cause acute appendicitis.<br />CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of an 8-year-old Sinhalese boy who developed acute appendicitis during the acute phase of serologically confirmed dengue fever. Although abdominal pain, vomiting and right-sided tenderness were present at the time of admission, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis was considered only 18 hours later, when abdominal guarding and a well-defined mass in the right iliac fossa were detected clinically and ultrasonographically. Conservative management with intravenous antibiotics was successful.<br />CONCLUSION: In areas where dengue is endemic, awareness of dengue viral infection as a non-surgical cause of acute abdomen, as well as its ability to mimic acute appendicitis, is important because unnecessary surgery-related morbidity can be decreased. However, delaying or missing the diagnosis of acute appendicitis can result in serious complications. This message is particularly relevant to clinicians, especially pediatricians and surgeons, who encounter large numbers of patients during dengue epidemics and run the risk of missing the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Likewise, delaying or missing the diagnosis of dengue hemorrhagic fever can lead to dengue shock syndrome and even death. This case highlights the need for careful evaluation of each patient who presents with acute abdomen and dengue infection.","24708584","2014",\N

"1004","Interval appendectomy in children clinical outcomes, financial costs and patient benefits.","Pediatric surgery international","BACKGROUND: Elective interval appendectomy (IA) is traditionally advocated for the management of appendiceal mass (AM) in children. Surgeons have debated the evidence and 'risks' vs. 'benefits' to support IA. There are currently no randomised controlled trials and guiding best practice and financial costings for IA are lacking. We herein report clinical outcomes, patient benefits and tariff charges linked with the provision of IA at a regional UK paediatric surgical centre.<br />METHODS: Hospital case records of patients with AM were identified using pathology records and hospital admission codes during a 15-year period (1997-2011). Tariff costs (Â£ Sterling) were calculated for all admissions during the era 2007-2011.<br />RESULTS: 69 children were admitted with AM (61% female, median age 10.5 years, range 2.1-16 years). Median initial hospital stay with resolution of symptoms was 8 days (range 3-14 days). 61 children (88%) had elective IA (median interval 76 days, range 29-230 days). Eight (12 %) patients required emergency readmission for early appendectomy (median interval 21 days, range 6-51 days). Hospital stay for emergency readmission appendectomy in these children was significantly longer than IA (median 6 vs. 3 days, p < 0.01). Laparoscopic appendectomy vs. 'open' appendectomy was associated with shorter length of stay in the IA cohort (median 3 vs. 2 days p < 0.01). No intra-operative morbidity was recorded in the study with only a single case developing a post-operative wound infection. Median cost for IA was Â£1,936. Costings were higher in the emergency appendectomy group-Â£2,171 vs. 1,936; p = 0.09, NS.<br />CONCLUSION: Only 12% of children at this centre develop recurrent appendicitis after primary admission with AM. Interval and emergency appendectomy were associated with low morbidity. Parents should be informed that IA may be 'non essential' surgery. Paediatric surgeons not routinely advocating IA can potentially save the NHS Â£1,936 per patient. Future randomised studies are warranted to confirm or refute these findings.","24874344","2014","7"

The agreement of sarcopenia diagnosed by IWGS and EWGSOP criteria was only fair by using either RASM or SMI (kappa = 0.448 by RASM, kappa = 0.471 by SMI). The prevalence of sarcopenia was lower by the IWGS definition than the EWGSOP definition, but it was remarkably lower by using RASM than SMI in both criteria. Overall, sarcopenic individuals defined by SMI were older, had a higher BMI but similar total skeletal muscle mass, and had poorer muscle strength and physical performance than nonsarcopenic individuals. However, by using RASM, sarcopenic individuals had less total skeletal muscle mass but similar BMI than nonsarcopenic individuals. Multivariable logistic regression showed that age was the strongest associative factor for sarcopenia in both IWGS and EWGSOP criteria. Obesity played a neutral role in sarcopenia when it is defined by using RASM, but significantly increased the risk of sarcopenia in both criteria by using SMI.<br />CONCLUSION: The agreement of sarcopenia defined by IWGS and EWGSOP was only fair, and the prevalence varied largely by using different skeletal muscle mass indices. Proper selections for cutoff values of handgrip strength, walking speed, and skeletal muscle indices with full considerations of gender and ethnic differences were of critical importance to reach the universal diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia internationally.","23664768","2013","7"

This study reports a previously healthy, 30-year-old man who came with chief complaint of acute abdominal pain to emergency room. On physical examination, abdominal tenderness and guarding were detected to be coincident with hypotension. Ultrasonography revealed mild splenomegaly with moderate free fluid in abdominopelvic cavity. Considering acute abdominal pain and hemodynamic instability, he underwent splenectomy with splenic rupture as the source of bleeding. Histologic examination showed diffuse infiltration by tumor. Immunohistochemical study (positive for S100, HMB45, and vimentin and negative for CK, CD10, CK20, CK7, CD30, LCA, EMA, and chromogranin) confirmed metastatic malignant melanoma. On further questioning, there was a past history of a nasal dark skin lesion which was removed two years ago with no pathologic examination. Spontaneous (nontraumatic) rupture of spleen is an uncommon situation and it happens very rarely due to neoplastic metastasis.

We conducted a prospective, randomized trial comparing single site laparoscopic appendectomy to the standard 3-port approach, including scar assessment at early and long-term follow-up.<br />METHODS: Enrolled patients over 12years old and parents of patients less than 12years old were asked to complete the validated Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire (PSAQ) at early follow-up around 6weeks and by phone after 18months. The PSAQ consists of 4 scored subscales: Appearance, Consciousness, Appearance Satisfaction, and Symptom Satisfaction. Each subscale has a set of questions with a 4-point categorical response (1=most favorable, 4=least favorable). The sum of the scores quantifies each subscale.<br />RESULTS: Early questionnaires were obtained from 98 3-port and 100 single-site patients with the single-site approach producing superior overall scar assessment (P=0.003). By telephone follow-up, questionnaires were completed by 49 3-port and 56 single-site patients at a median of 25 (18-32) months. In this longer-term follow-up, overall scar assessment was not significantly different between groups (P=0.06).<br />CONCLUSION: Patients or parents express superior scar assessment with the single site approach at early follow-up, but this difference disappears in the long-term.","24439594","2014","1"

The use of postoperative antibiotics is only recommended in cases of perforation, and treatment should then be given intravenously, for a minimum period of 3-5 days for adult patients, until clinical signs such as fever resolve and laboratory parameters such as C-reactive protein curve and white blood cell (WBC) start to decline.<br />CONCLUSION: Preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended in all patients with acute appendicitis, whereas postoperative antibiotics only in cases of perforation.","24056131","2014","3"
"1011","Are there guidelines for reporting clinical research findings in oral lectures and seminars in dental meetings?","British dental journal","Dental meetings are one of the most important resources for disseminating knowledge to dental practitioners. Therefore, the information provided in such meetings should be as unbiased as possible. This paper assessed whether major general dentistry and periodontology/implant dentistry meetings have guidelines for reporting scientific evidence in oral lectures and seminars. The homepages of seven dental meetings (EUROPERIO, AAP, EAO, AO, IADR, ADA, and FDI) were assessed to check for guidelines for presenting scientific data in oral lectures and seminars, according to defined criteria. Only three of these dental meetings reported information for presentations on their homepages, although these guidelines were related to technical issues rather than recommendations for the presentation of scientific data. The present paper suggests guidelines for reporting scientific evidence in oral lectures and seminars in dental meetings to improve the current standards of reporting. High standards of reporting may provide less biased information, which is necessary for dental practitioners and clinicians to make accurate judgements on the efficacy/effectiveness of therapies.","23518971","2013","3"
"1012","Reconstructing the lower urinary tract: The Mitrofanoff principle.","Indian journal of urology : IJU : journal of the Urological Society of India","Since the original description of the trans-appendicular continent cystostomy by Mitrofanoff in 1980, a variety of techniques have been described for creating a continent catheterisable channel leading to the bladder, which avoids the native urethra. The Mitrofanoff principle involves the creation of a conduit going into a low pressure reservoir, which can emptied through clean intermittent catheterization through an easily accessible stoma. A variety of tissue segments have been used for creating the conduit, but the two popular options in current urological practice remain the appendix and Yang-Monti transverse ileal tube. The Mitrofanoff procedure has an early reoperation rate for bleeding, bowel obstruction, anastomotic leak or conduit breakdown of up to 8% and the most common long-term complication noted is stomal stenosis resulting in difficulty catheterizing the conduit. However, in both pediatric and adult setting, reports imply that the procedure is durable although it is associated with an overall re-operation rate of up to 32% in contemporary series. Initial reports of laparoscopic and robotic-assisted Mitrofanoff procedures are encouraging, but long-term outcomes are still awaited.","24235794","2013","10"

[et al] = Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Kinderchirurgie","Fast-track concepts in pediatric surgery were established in a university hospital in consecutive studies within several years. They significantly reduced the length of hospitalization compared with German institutions without fast-track protocols. The aim of this study was to assess the implementation process of fast-track in a German nonacademic department of pediatric surgery without previous fast-track experience. All patients undergoing four types of operations (appendectomy, hypospadias repair, pyloromyotomy, and fundoplication) from February 2011 to January 2012 were included in this prospective study. Fast-track included detailed clinical pathways and specific pain treatment protocols using validated pain scales according to age. Mobilization and oral nutrition were started 2 hours postoperatively and documented with established scores. The length of hospital stay was compared with data from other hospitals with conventional treatment using information from the German reimbursement system (German diagnosis-related groups [G-DRG]) and with the hospital stay of patients from the corresponding university hospital undergoing fast-track treatment for the same procedures during the same study period. Two weeks after discharge, a questionnaire was completed by the patients/parents. A total of 143 patients with a mean age of 7.9â€‰Â±â€‰5.0 years underwent fast-track treatment. The mean pain intensity during the immediate postoperative period was 1.7â€‰Â±â€‰2.1 in patientsâ€‰<â€‰4 years and 2.3â€‰Â±â€‰2.1 in patients â‰¥â€‰4 years on a 10-point scale. Full mobilization was reached after a mean duration of 2.3â€‰Â±â€‰2.0 days while full oral nutrition was completed after a mean duration of 1.8â€‰Â±â€‰1.4 days. There were no complications associated with fast-track. The mean hospital stay was 5.8â€‰Â±â€‰3.4 days which was not significantly different compared with G-DRG data from other hospitals without fast-track. This was in contrast to the mean hospital stay of patients from the corresponding university hospital (5.6â€‰Â±â€‰3.0 days vs. G-DRG 6.9â€‰Â±â€‰3.2 days, pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). After 2 weeks, patients/parents were highly satisfied with fast-track (mean score of 8.6â€‰Â±â€‰1.4 on a 1-10-point scale) and 95.2% claimed that they would choose it again. Fast-track concepts can be applied in a nonacademic department of pediatric surgery without previous fast-track experience and with excellent patient/parent satisfaction. However, the G-DRG system interferes with concepts of early discharge of patients. Modifications of the reimbursement modalities within the German health care system seem to be mandatory.","24008549","2014","10"

The most frequent symptoms were chronic (52.3%) and acute (25.4%) abdominal pain. Histological examination revealed 64 (46.7%) functional lesions, 59 (43.1%) benign neoplasms, 5 (3.7%) malignant ones, and 7 (6.6%) torsed normal ovaries. Ovarian torsion occurred in 36 cases (26.27%). A conservative treatment was performed in 81 (59.1%) girls: 61 (75.3%) treated in nonemergency and 20 (24.7%) in emergency surgery; laparoscopic approach in 35 cases (43.2%); and open surgery in 46 (56.8%).

Fertility preservation should be a goal in the surgical treatment. The management of ovarian torsion should include adnexal detorsion and recovery of the ovarian tissue. In case of benign neoplasms, laparoscopic tumorectomy should be the gold standard; in early stage malignant tumors, fertility-sparing surgery with accurate staging is preferred.","24274683","2013","11"

The American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines that do not guide.","International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology","OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the recently published guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) on acute otitis media (AOM) are in line with the requirements set by the GRADE system (grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation system of rating quality of evidence and grading strength of recommendations in systematic reviews, health technology assessments, and clinical practice guidelines) and to compare them with the most recently published related guidelines (Korean and Japanese).<br />RESULTS: The AAP guidelines fail to answer the simple and explicit fundamental question on pediatric AOM management: whether antibiotics should be prescribed or not in non-severe AOM. Instead of giving a type C recommendation (option) if the available evidence was considered as inadequate or even a type D (no recommendation) the AAP guideline is to prescribe antibiotics or offer a watchful waiting for 48-72 h (strength of recommendation type B). This is in sharp contrast with the most recent guidelines (Korean and Japanese) that both recommend watchful waiting for 48-72 h (with the highest strength of recommendation - type A).<br />CONCLUSION: The AAP guidelines do not seem to be in line with the GRADE system as in an important, simple, and explicit question on: antibiotic administration in non- severe AOM, given in an ambiguous statement. This statement is in reality a vicious circle as the guidelines avoid to take any side and do not even categorize the answer as an option.","25045770","2014","7"

Patients with ICUE mainly present with insidious abdominal symptoms such as chronic abdominal pain and intermittent gastrointestinal hemorrhage and symptoms of malnourishment in the early stages of the disease. ICUE is always difficult to diagnose. However, as the disease progresses, patients have a variety of acute abdominal complications such as hemorrhage, perforation, or ileus. Surgical intervention is always needed, and the condition can recur and require repeat laparotomy. When diffuse ulceration of the small bowel is present in the absence of recognizable causes, it is classified as nonspecific or idiopathic. The histological examination always demonstrates an acute, chronic inflammatory infiltration without giant cells, granulomas, or villous atrophy. The etiology of ICUE has not been identified, and its pathogenesis is poorly understood; therefore, radical surgical resection is considered the best available treatment. Here, we report a case of ICUE characterized by nonspecific, multiple, small intestinal ulcers resulting in perforation and recurrent bleeding. The differential diagnosis and the treatment are also discussed.","23922486","2013","8"

Twenty-three subjects with histologically-proven tumors (17 appendicular, 6 axial) underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with T1-weighted spin echo (T1SE), fluid-sensitive, CSI, and contrast-enhanced T1 sequences. One observer recorded intra-medullary tumor extent (millimeters), with 153 total measurements on each sequence. Red marrow grade [0 (none), 1 (<50%), 2 (50-75%) and 3 (>75%)] in each bone was recorded. Tumor extent on different sequences was compared (Student's t-test); the impact of red marrow grade on measurements was assessed (Spearman's correlation coefficient).<br />RESULTS: There was good agreement between measurements of tumor extent on T1SE and CSI sequences in all cases (T1SE-CSI measurement difference range 0-13.2 mm, P>0.05). Measurements from other sequences were significantly different from those of T1SE (P<0.05). As red marrow grade in the bone increased, a significant increase in measurement difference obtained on T1SE and CSI sequences was observed (P<0.001).<br />CONCLUSIONS: CSI is a potential alternative technique to T1SE imaging for defining the intra-medullary extent of a bone tumor, possibly especially useful in regions with abundant red marrow.<br />ADVANCE IN KNOWLEDGE: CSI could be an alternative technique to T1SE imaging for defining the intra-medullary extent of bone tumor by abundant red marrow in the surrounding bone.","24914418","2014","6"

"1021","Tyrosine residues play an important role in heme detoxification by serum albumin.","Biochimica et biophysica acta","BACKGROUND: Serum albumin binds avidly to heme to form heme-serum albumin complex, also called methemalbumin, and this binding is thought to protect against the potentially toxic effects of heme. However, the mechanism of detoxification has not been fully elucidated.<br />METHODS: SDS-PAGE and Western blot were used to determine the efficiency of methemalbumin on catalyzing protein carbonylation and nitration. HPLC was used to test the formation of heme to protein cross-linked methemalbumin.<br />RESULTS: The peroxidase activity of heme increased upon human serum albumin (HSA) binding. Methemalbumin showed higher efficiency in catalyzing tyrosine oxidation than free heme in the presence of H2O2. Methemalbumin catalyzed self-nitration and significantly promoted the nitration of tyrosine in coexistent protein, but decreased the carbonylation of coexistent protein compared with heme. The heme to protein cross-linked form of methemalbumin suggested that HSA trapped the free radical accompanied by the formation of ferryl heme. When tyrosine residues in HSA were modified by iodination, HSA lost of protection effect on protein carbonylation. The low concentration of glutathione could effectively inhibit tyrosine nitration, but had no effect on protein carbonylation.<br />CONCLUSION: HSA protects against the toxic effect of heme by transferring the free radical to tyrosine residues in HSA, therefore protecting surrounding proteins from irreversible oxidation, rather than by direct inhibiting the peroxidase activity. The increased tyrosine radicals can be reduced by endogenic antioxidants such as GSH.<br />GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This investigation indicated the important role of tyrosine residues in heme detoxification by HSA and suggested a possible novel mechanism.","24252277","2014","3"

A significant muscle mass loss, necessary to diagnose sarcopenia, was defined in 3 different ways: (1) by subtracting 2 SDs from the mean ASMM index (ASMMI) of a young adult population (20-39 year-olds), as in the Rosetta study and the NHANES survey; (2) by calculating the 15th percentile of the distribution of our young population, corresponding to about 1 SD below the mean ASMMI; (3) by calculating the 20th percentile of the distribution of the ASMMI (as in the Health ABC study) of an elderly population.<br />SETTING: Five centers for the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis in various parts of the country (Padova, Verona, Parma, Roma, Napoli).<br />PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 1535 volunteers (1208 women and 327 men) aged 20 to 80 years, drawn from among staff members, university students, lay people contacted by word of mouth, and patients presenting spontaneously for osteoporosis screening.<br />MEASUREMENTS: Body weight and height were measured for all participants. Body composition was assessed by DEXA, and the ASMMI was calculated as the ASMM divided by body height in meters squared.<br />RESULTS: Both men's and women's lean mass in the arms and ASMM were highest in the young group and became lower in older age. In men, the ASMMI dropped gradually from age 20 to 29 to age 60 to 69, then remained stable in the oldest group. In women, the ASMMI gradually increased from age 20 to 29 to age 60 to 69, then dropped among the 70- to 80-year-olds. Based on the 15th percentile of the ASMMI for our young adult reference population, the cutoffs for sarcopenia were 7.59 kg/m(2) in men and 5.47 kg/m(2) in women; if the 20th percentile of the ASMMI in our elderly subjects (>65 years) was considered, the cutoffs were 7.64 kg/m(2) in men and 5.78 kg/m(2) in women. Applying the different diagnostic criteria to the those older than 65, the prevalence of sarcopenia ranged from 0% to about 20% in both genders.<br />CONCLUSION: The 15th percentile (or 1 SD below the mean) of the ASMMI of our young adults, and the 20th percentile of this index for an elderly reference population proved more effective in identifying cases of sarcopenia than subtracting 2 SD from the mean ASMMI of a young adult population.","23582341","2013","7"

"1026","Massachusetts health care reform and reduced racial disparities in minimally invasive surgery.","JAMA surgery","IMPORTANCE: Racial disparities in receipt of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) persist in the United States and have been shown to also be associated with a number of driving factors, including insurance status. However, little is known as to how expanding insurance coverage across a population influences disparities in surgical care.<br />OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of Massachusetts health care reform on racial disparities in MIS.<br />DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study assessed the probability of undergoing MIS vs an open operation for nonwhite patients in Massachusetts compared with 6 control states. All discharges (nâ€‰=â€‰167,560) of nonelderly white, black, or Latino patients with government insurance (Medicaid or Commonwealth Care insurance) or no insurance who underwent a procedure for acute appendicitis or acute cholecystitis at inpatient hospitals between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2009, were assessed. Data are from the Hospital Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases.<br />INTERVENTION: The 2006 Massachusetts health care reform, which expanded insurance coverage for government-subsidized, self-pay, and uninsured individuals in Massachusetts.<br />MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Adjusted probability of undergoing MIS and difference-in-difference estimates.<br />RESULTS: Prior to the 2006 reform, Massachusetts nonwhite patients had a 5.21-percentage point lower probability of MIS relative to white patients (Pâ€‰<â€‰.001). Nonwhite patients in control states had a 1.39-percentage point lower probability of MIS (Pâ€‰=â€‰.007). After reform, nonwhite patients in Massachusetts had a 3.71-percentage point increase in the probability of MIS relative to concurrent trends in control states (Pâ€‰=â€‰.01). After 2006, measured racial disparities in MIS resolved in Massachusetts, with nonwhite patients having equal probability of MIS relative to white patients (0.06 percentage point greater; Pâ€‰=â€‰.96). However, nonwhite patients in control states without health care reform have a persistently lower probability of MIS relative to white patients (3.19 percentage points lower; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001).<br />CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The 2006 Massachusetts insurance expansion was associated with an increased probability of nonwhite patients undergoing MIS and resolution of measured racial disparities in MIS.","24089326","2013","12"

High-quality relevant evidence is limited.<br />METHODS: A systematic review of electronic information sources was undertaken, with the objective of identifying randomized trials that compared single-incision with conventional laparoscopic appendectomy. Outcome measures included 30-day morbidity, abdominal abscess, wound infection, open conversion, reoperation, operative time, length of hospital stay, and postoperative pain. Fixed-effects and random-effects models were used to calculate combined overall effect sizes of pooled data. Data are presented as odds ratios or weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).<br />RESULTS: Five randomized trials were identified, with a total of 746 patients. Thirty-day morbidity (9.6% vs 8.6%; odds ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, .69 to 1.89) and wound infection rates were similar between single-incision and conventional laparoscopy (4.0% vs 4.8%; odds ratio, .83; 95% CI, .41 to 1.68), whereas the duration of surgery was longer in the single-incision group (46.3 vs 40.7 minutes; weighted mean difference, 6.01; 95% CI, 2.26 to 9.76). Available data were not adequately robust to reach conclusions regarding the remaining outcome measures.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Similar postoperative morbidity and wound infection rates for single-incision and conventional laparoscopic appendectomy are supported by the current literature, but single-incision surgery requires longer operative time.","24370108","2014","4"
"1028","Ultrasonographic diagnosis of midgut volvulus with malrotation in children.","Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition","OBJECTIVES: Midgut volvulus with malrotation is typical in newborns. We present our experience to emphasize the importance of suspecting midgut volvulus as a cause of abdominal pain also beyond infancy, particularly in relation to malrotation, and the relevance of ultrasonographic (US) signs in its diagnosis.<br />METHODS: A total of 34 patients (10 boys, 24 girls; ages between 1 day and 12 years) diagnosed as having malrotation or malrotation with volvulus, surgically confirmed, between 2006 and 2013 were retrospectively selected among all of the patients referred to our institution for acute abdomen and bilious vomiting. All of them underwent US and color Doppler examination before surgery. The US examinations were performed with 6 to 10 MHz microconvex and 7.5 to 10 Mhz linear transducer. The transducer was placed under xiphoid, and, with axial projection, the presence of anatomic position reversed between superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA), as a sign of malrotation, and the presence of \"whirlpool sign\" (WS) (wrapping of the SMV and the mesentery around the SMA), as a sign of midgut volvulus, were evaluated.<br />RESULTS: In 27 of these 34 patients, midgut volvulus was present; 7 patients had intestinal malrotation. In 2 of 7 (28%) patients with malrotation, SMA and SMV were inverted. Among the patients with volvulus, 2 showed reversed vessel position and 22 patients presented the WS in association with SMA/SMV inversion (22/27, 81%).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Midgut volvulus with malrotation can appear beyond the neonatal age group as demonstrated in our case. The WS sign is sufficiently sensitive for its diagnosis and should be routinely researched at all ages of pediatric population. Anatomic inversion between SMV and SMA seems to be not enough sensitive in isolated malrotation diagnosis.","25023580","2014","12"
"1029","Large twisted ovarian fibroma associated with Meigs' syndrome, abdominal pain and severe anemia treated by laparoscopic surgery.","BMC surgery","BACKGROUND: The Meigs' syndrome is a rare but well-known syndrome defined as the triad of benign solid ovarian tumor, ascites, and pleural effusion. Meigs' syndrome always requires surgical treatment. However, the optimal approach for its management has not been sufficiently investigated.<br />CASE PRESENTATION: We report a patient with a large twisted ovarian fibroma associated with Meigs' syndrome, abdominal pain and severe hemolytic anemia that was treated by laparoscopic surgery. This case highlights the difficulties that may be encountered in the management of patients with Meigs' syndrome, including potential misdiagnosis of the tumor as a malignant ovarian neoplasm that may influence the medical and surgical approach and the adverse impact that Meigs' syndrome can have on the patient's condition, especially if it is associated with acute pain and severe anemia. Considering the patient's serious clinical condition and assuming that she had Meigs' syndrome with a twisted large ovarian mass and possible hemolytic anemia, we first concentrated on effective medical management of our patient and chose the most appropriate surgical treatment after laparoscopic examination. The main aim of our initial approach was preoperative management of the anemia. Blood transfusions and glucocorticoid therapy resulted in stabilization of the hemoglobin level and normalization of the bilirubin levels, which confirmed the appropriateness of this approach. Laparoscopic surgery 4 days after admission enabled definitive diagnosis of the tumor, confirmed torsion and removed the bulky ovarian fibroma, resulting in timely resolution of symptoms, short hospitalization, relatively low morbidity and a rapid return to her social and professional life.<br />CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the difficulties that may be encountered in the management of patients with Meigs' syndrome, including potential misdiagnosis of the tumor as a malignant ovarian neoplasm that may influence the medical and surgical approach, and the adverse impact that Meigs' syndrome can have on the patient's condition, especially if it is associated with acute pain and severe anemia. The present case suggests that laparoscopic surgery for potentially large malignant tumors is feasible and safe, but requires an appropriate medical and gynecological oncology expertise.","24962423","2014",\N
"1030","The effect of \"single\" vs \"double\" eyelids on the perceived attractiveness of Chinese women.","Aesthetic surgery journal / the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic surgery","BACKGROUND: A well-defined supratarsal crease has often been considered attractive, representing a significant component in a beautiful upper eyelid. Approximately 50% of East and Southeast Asian women are born with either a minimal or absent supratarsal eyelid crease. Among people of Chinese descent, the creation of a supratarsal crease (\"double\" eyelid blepharoplasty) is the most common cosmetic surgical procedure, but no comparative study has assessed the height by which an upper eyelid crease is deemed most attractive and depending on cultural background.<br />OBJECTIVES: The authors assess how attractiveness is interpreted by different cultural groups to determine whether double-eyelid blepharoplasty enhances attractiveness according to both Chinese and non-Chinese observers.<br />METHODS: Facial photographs were taken of 19 women of Chinese descent. The photographs were enhanced with computer imaging software to generate 3 additional pictures, depicting low, medium, and high upper eyelid creases on each model. Via an Internet-based survey tool, Chinese and non-Chinese observers were asked to rate the attractiveness of the faces with each potential eyelid position. (Surveys are available online at www.aestheticsurgeryjournal.com, as Appendix 1 and Appendix 2.)<br />RESULTS: Both Chinese and non-Chinese observers considered the medium-height upper eyelid crease most attractive (P < .00001). An absent upper eyelid crease was deemed the least attractive (P < .00001).<br />CONCLUSIONS: These preference data for eyelid height can be used to better counsel patients on perceived attractiveness and expectations for surgical results, since these results further elucidate which facial features are universally considered attractive.","24604790","2014","3"
"1031","Refined avian risk assessment for chlorpyrifos in the United States.","Reviews of environmental contamination and toxicology","Refined risk assessments for birds exposed to flowable and granular formulations ofCPY were conducted for a range of current use patterns in the United States. Overall,the collective evidence from the modeling and field study lines of evidence indicate that flowable and granular CPY do not pose significant risks to the bird communities foraging in agro-ecosystems in the United States. The available information indicates that avian incidents resulting from the legal, registered uses of CPY have been very infrequent since 2002 (see SI Appendix 3). The small number of recent incidents suggests that the current labels for CPY are generally protective of birds.However, incident data are uncertain because of the difficulties associated with finding dead birds in the field and linking any mortality observed to CPY.Plowable CPY is registered for a variety of crops in the United States including alfalfa, brassica vegetables, citrus, corn, cotton, grape, mint, onion, peanut, pome and stone fruits, soybean, sugar beet, sunflower, sweet potato, tree nuts, and wheat under the trade name Lorsban Advanced. The major routes of exposure for birds to flowable CPY were consumption of treated dietary items and drinking water. The Liquid Pesticide Avian Risk Assessment Model (Liquid PARAM) was used to simulate avian ingestion of CPY by these routes of exposure. For acute exposure,Liquid PARAM estimated the maximum retained dose in each of 20 birds on each of1,000 fields that were treated with CPY over the 60-d period following initial application.The model used a 1-h time step. For species lacking acceptable acute oral toxicity data (all focal species except northern bobwhite (C. virginianus) and redwinged blackbird (A. phoeniceus)), a species sensitivity distribution (SSD) approach was used to generate hypothetical dose-response curves assuming high, median and low sensitivity to CPY. For acute risk, risk curves were generated for each use pattern and exposure scenario. The risk curves show the relationship between exceedence probability and percent mortality. The results of the Liquid PARAM modeling exercise indicate that flow able CPY poses an acute risk to some bird species, particularly those species that are highly sensitive and that forage extensively in crops with high maximum application rates (e.g., grapefruit, orange). Overall, most bird species would not experience significant mortality as a result of exposure to flowable CPY.The results of a number of field studies conducted at application rates comparable to those on the Lorsban Advanced label indicate that flowable CPY rarely causes avian mortality. The results of the field studies suggest that Liquid PARAM is likely over-estimating acute risk to birds for flowable CPY.For chronic exposure, Liquid PARAM estimated the maximum total daily intake (TDI) over a user-specified exposure duration (28-d in the case of CPY).The maximum average TDI was compared to the chronic NOEL and LOEL from the most sensitive species tested for CPY, the mallard. This comparison was done for each of the 20 birds in each of the 1000 fields simulated in Liquid PARAM.The outpuÂ· ~ are estimates of the probabilities of exceeding the NOEL and LOEL.Liquid PAkAM did not predict significant adverse effects resulting from chronic exposure to flowable CPY. The small number of incidents (2) involving CPY reported since 2002 suggests that the current labels for CPY are generally protective of birds.Granular CPY is registered for a wide variety of crops including brassica vegetables, corn, onion, peanut, sugar beet, sunflower, and tobacco under the trade name Lorsban 15G. Consumption of grit is required by many birds to aid in digestion of hard dietary items such as seeds and insects. Because CPY granules are in the same size range as natural grit particles consumed by birds, there is a potential for birds to mistakenly ingest granular CPY instead of natural grit. We developed the Granular Pesticide Avian Risk Model (GranPARAM) to simulate grit ingestion behavior by birds. The model accounts for proportion of time that birds forage for grit in treated fields, relative proportions of natural grit versus pesticide granules onthe surface of treated fields, rates of ingestion of grit, attractiveness of pesticide granules relative to natural grit and so on. For CPY, each model simulation included20 birds on each of 1,000 fields to capture variability in rates of ingestion of grit and for aging behavior between birds within a focal species, and variability in soil composition between fields for the selected use pattern. The estimated dose for each birdwas compared with randomly chosen doses from relevant dose-response curves forCPY. Our analysis for a wide variety of use patterns on the Lorsban 15G label found that granular CPY poses little risk of causing mortality to bird species that frequent treated fields immediately after application.

However, muscle strength and muscle mass are not congruent; muscle strength can diminish even though muscle mass is maintained or increased. This study addresses phenotype and mortality associations of these muscle dysfunction entities alone or in combination (i.e., concurrent loss of muscle mass and strength/mobility, here defined as sarcopenia).<br />DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This study included 330 incident dialysis patients (203 men, mean age 53Â±13 years, and mean GFR 7Â±2 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) recruited between 1994 and 2010 and followed prospectively for up to 5 years. Low muscle mass (by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry appendicular mass index) and low muscle strength (by handgrip) were defined against young reference populations according to the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People.<br />RESULTS: Whereas 20% of patients had sarcopenia, low muscle mass and low muscle strength alone were observed in a further 24% and 15% of patients, respectively. Old age, comorbidities, protein-energy wasting, physical inactivity, low albumin, and inflammation associated with low muscle strength, but not with low muscle mass (multivariate ANOVA interactions). During follow-up, 95 patients (29%) died and both conditions associated with mortality as separate entities. When combined, individuals with low muscle mass alone were not at increased risk of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.23; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.56 to 2.67). Individuals with low muscle strength were at increased risk, irrespective of their muscle stores being appropriate (HR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.01 to 3.87) or low (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.01 to 3.71).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Low muscle strength was more strongly associated with aging, protein-energy wasting, physical inactivity, inflammation, and mortality than low muscle mass.

This study assessed the effectiveness of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), sphincterotomy and biliary stenting in the management of postoperative bile leaks.<br />METHODS: An ERCP database in a tertiary referral centre was reviewed retrospectively to identify all patients with bile leaks after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patient records and endoscopy reports were reviewed.<br />RESULTS: One hundred and thirteen patients (92 women, 21 men; median age 47 years, range 22 - 82 years) with a bile leak were referred for initial endoscopic management at a median of 12 days (range 2 - 104 days) after surgery. Presenting features included intra-abdominal collections with pain in 58 cases (51.3%), abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) in 22 (19.5%), bile leak in 25 (22.1%), and sepsis in 8 (7.1%). Twenty-nine patients (25.7%) were found to have either major bile duct injuries without duct continuity, vascular injuries or other endoscopic findings requiring surgical or radiological intervention. Of 84 patients managed endoscopically, 44 had a cystic duct (CD) leak, 26 a CD leak and common bile duct (CBD) stones, and 14 a CBD injury amenable to endoscopic stenting. Of the 70 patients with CD leaks (group A), 24 underwent sphincterotomy only (including 8 stone extractions), 43 had a sphincterotomy with stent placement (including 18 stone extractions) and 1 had only a stent placed, while 2 patients with previous sphincterotomies required no further intervention. The average number of ERCPs in group A was 2.3 (range 1 - 7). Of the 14 patients with bile duct injuries treated endoscopically (group B), 7 had a class D, 5 an E5 and 2 a class B injury; 13 patients underwent sphincterotomy and stenting, and 1 had a sphincterotomy only.

The primary outcome was the percentage of time in the target range for the international normalized ratio (INR; target range, 2.0 to 3.0) in the 12-week period after the initiation of therapy. Owing to low enrollment, the two trials were combined for analysis. The primary outcome was assessed in patients who remained in the trial for at least 10 weeks.<br />RESULTS: A total of 548 patients were enrolled (273 patients in the genotype-guided group and 275 in the control group). The follow-up was at least 10 weeks for 239 patients in the genotype-guided group and 245 in the control group. The percentage of time in the therapeutic INR range was 61.6% for patients receiving genotype-guided dosing and 60.2% for those receiving clinically guided dosing (P=0.52). There were no significant differences between the two groups for several secondary outcomes. The percentage of time in the therapeutic range during the first 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment in the two groups was 52.8% and 47.5% (P=0.02), respectively. There were no significant differences with respect to the incidence of bleeding or thromboembolic events.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Genotype-guided dosing of acenocoumarol or phenprocoumon did not improve the percentage of time in the therapeutic INR range during the 12 weeks after the initiation of therapy.

"1041","Common postoperative findings unique to laparoscopic surgery.","Radiographics : a review publication of the Radiological Society of North America, Inc","The interpretation of images obtained in patients who have recently undergone abdominal or pelvic surgery is challenging, in part because procedures that were previously performed with open surgical techniques are increasingly being performed with minimally invasive (laparoscopic) techniques. Thus, it is important to be familiar with the normal approach used for laparoscopic surgeries. The authors describe the indications for various laparoscopic surgical procedures (eg, cholecystectomy, appendectomy, hernia repair) as well as normal postoperative findings. For example, port site hernias are more commonly encountered in patients with trocar sites greater than 10 mm and occur at classic entry sites (eg, the periumbilical region). Similarly, preperitoneal air can be encountered postoperatively, often secondary to trocar dislodgement during difficult entry or positioning. In addition, intraperitoneal placement of mesh during commonly performed ventral or incisional hernia repairs typically leads to postoperative seroma formation. Familiarity with normal findings after commonly performed laparoscopic surgical procedures in the abdomen and pelvis allows accurate diagnosis of common complications and avoidance of diagnostic pitfalls.","24428286",\N,\N

Here we analyzed two and three genomes of P. granulosum and P. avidum, respectively, and compared them to two genomes of P. acnes; we further highlight differences among the three cutaneous species with proteomic and microscopy approaches.<br />RESULTS: Electron and atomic force microscopy revealed an exopolysaccharide (EPS)-like structure surrounding P. avidum cells, that is absent in P. acnes and P. granulosum. In contrast, P. granulosum possesses pili-like appendices, which was confirmed by surface proteome analysis. The corresponding genes were identified; they are clustered with genes encoding sortases. Both, P. granulosum and P. avidum lack surface or secreted proteins for predicted host-interacting factors of P. acnes, including several CAMP factors, sialidases, dermatan-sulphate adhesins, hyaluronidase and a SH3 domain-containing lipoprotein; accordingly, only P. acnes exhibits neuraminidase and hyaluronidase activities. These functions are encoded on previously unrecognized island-like regions in the genome of P. acnes.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Despite their omnipresence on human skin little is known about the role of cutaneous propionibacteria. All three species are associated with a variety of diseases, including postoperative and device-related abscesses and infections. We showed that the three organisms have evolved distinct features to interact with their human host. Whereas P. avidum and P. granulosum produce an EPS-like surface structure and pili-like appendices, respectively, P. acnes possesses a number of unique surface-exposed proteins with host-interacting properties. The different surface properties of the three cutaneous propionibacteria are likely to determine their colonizing ability and pathogenic potential on the skin and at non-skin sites.","24053623","2013",\N
"1043","[Role of heat flow generated by an abdominal cavity in monitoring of acute surgical pathology of abdominal organs].","Georgian medical news","Despite of significant development of modern surgery results of treatment of acute diffused peritonitis and acute intestinal obstruction are still unsatisfactory. Successful treatment of these conditions depends considerably on timely and adequate diagnosing as it gives a choice of optimal treatment tactics. Measuring of a human body heat flow in areas of organs affected by pathology in cases of acute diffused peritonitis and acute intestinal obstruction provides a possibility to improve the principles of early differential diagnosing, to form new approaches to treatment tactics and monitoring of general health status of a patient during early postoperative treatment. 47 patient suffering from acute diffused peritonitis and 42 patients suffering from acute intestinal obstruction have been examined; the patients were divided into groups based on abdominal cavity exudates character, intestinal obstruction type and intra-abdominal hypertension grade. Measurement of abdominal cavity heat flow was performed by a contact method with use of thermoelectric medical thermometer. Intra-abdominal hypertension was measured by generally used transvesical method. It has been established that abdominal cavity heat flow correlates with character of abdominal cavity exudates; this is also confirmed by reliable difference between serous peritonitis and fibrinopurulent peritonitis indices. Indices in case of acute intestinal obstruction are lower than ones in case of acute diffused peritonitis as there are no inflammatory changes of peritoneum. Development of intra-abdominal hypertension of grades 3-4 directly influences the heat flow extent; this is explained by accelerated and aggravated pathological changes of inner organs cased by the main disease. Thus, abdominal cavity heat flow fully reflects degree of purulent and inflammatory processes of abdominal cavity organs and can be used for additional diagnosing and clinical course monitoring.","24013143",\N,\N
"1044","Prevalence and spatial distribution of Theileria parva in cattle under crop-livestock farming systems in Tororo District, Eastern Uganda.","Parasites & vectors","BACKGROUND: Tick-borne diseases (TBDs) present a major economic burden to communities across East Africa. Farmers in East Africa must use acaracides to target ticks and prevent transmission of tick-borne diseases such as anaplasmosis, babesiosis, cowdriosis and theileriosis; the major causes of cattle mortality and morbidity. The costs of controlling East Coast Fever (ECF), caused by Theileria parva, in Uganda are significant and measures taken to control ticks, to be cost-effective, should take into account the burden of disease. The aim of the present work was to estimate the burden presented by T. parva and its spatial distribution in a crop-livestock production system in Eastern Uganda.<br />METHODS: A cross sectional study was carried out to determine the prevalence and spatial distribution of T. parva in Tororo District, Uganda. Blood samples were taken from all cattle (n: 2,658) in 22 randomly selected villages across Tororo District from September to December 2011. Samples were analysed by PCR and T. parva prevalence and spatial distribution determined.<br />RESULTS: The overall prevalence of T. parva was found to be 5.3%. Herd level prevalence ranged from 0% to 21% with majority of the infections located in the North, North-Eastern and South-Eastern parts of Tororo District. No statistically significant differences in risk of infection were found between age classes, sex and cattle breed.<br />CONCLUSIONS: T. parva infection is widely distributed in Tororo District, Uganda. The prevalence and distribution of T. parva is most likely determined by spatial distribution of R. appendiculatus, restricted grazing of calves and preferential tick control targeting draft animals.","24589227","2014",\N
"1045","The natural history of HIV-associated lipodystrophy in the changing scenario of HIV infection.","HIV medicine","OBJECTIVES: In long-term HIV-infected patients, peripheral lipoatrophy (LA) and central lipohypertrophy (LH) appear to be related to the same insults (virus and antiretroviral drugs), but are likely to be associated with different fat depot physiologies. The objective of this study was to describe the natural history of lipodystrophy assessed using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and computed tomography (CT) in a large HIV out-patients metabolic clinic.<br />METHODS: An observational retrospective study was carried out including HIV-infected patients recruited at the Metabolic Clinic of Modena, Modena, Italy, who were assessed for lipodystrophy and had at least two anthropometric evaluations using DEXA for leg fat per cent mass and abdominal CT for visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Factors associated with leg fat per cent and VAT changes were analysed using multivariable generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression models.<br />RESULTS: A total of 6789 DEXAs and 7566 CT scans were evaluated in the observation period. A total of 1840 patients were included; the mean age was 45.2â€‰Â±â€‰7.2 (standard deviation) years, 621 (34%) were women, and the median HIV infection duration was 176 (interquartile range 121-232) years. According to the GEE multivariable regression analysis, leg fat per cent evaluated with DEXA appeared to increase over calendar years (ÃŸâ€‰=â€‰0.92; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001); moreover, a progressive increase in VAT was observed in the cohort (ÃŸâ€‰=â€‰5.69; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). No association with antiretroviral drugs was found.<br />CONCLUSIONS: In our study, neither LA nor LH appeared to be associated with antiretroviral drug exposure. We observed a progressive increase in LH in HIV-infected patients over calendar years. This anthropometric change, together with loss of appendicular lean mass, could describe a physiological aging process in HIV-infected patients.","24750806","2014","11"

We describe the first reported case in the emergency medicine literature of acute lobar nephronia (ALN).<br />OBJECTIVES: To describe the presentation, evaluation, and management of acute lobar nephronia.<br />CASE REPORT: A healthy 27-year-old woman presented after 18 h of fever to 39.94Â°C (103.9Â°F), nausea, vomiting, and severe right-sided abdominal pain. Despite a normal urinalysis, a contrasted computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated right perinephric stranding, which was initially interpreted as pyelonephritis. A staff over-read the following day by a radiology body specialist confirmed \"likely developing abscess,\" consistent with the diagnosis of acute lobar nephronia.<br />CONCLUSION: A normal urinalysis may move clinicians to dismiss a nephrogenic or urologic process. ALN is considered a midpoint in the spectrum of upper urinary tract infections between acute pyelonephritis and intrarenal abscess. Diagnosis may be difficult, and inpatient management, sometimes prolonged, is the norm.","24286715","2014","5"

However, a gas leak can significantly affect transvaginal operations during pneumoperitoneum laparoscopy. We tried to establish the proper technique for transvaginal appendectomy under gasless laparoscopy.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five patients with chronic appendicitis were selected to receive gasless laparoscopic transvaginal appendectomy with concurrent vaginal hysterectomy. An abdominal wall-lifting device was applied after removal of the uterus, and the appendix was removed transvaginally. Clinical data such as operative duration, bleeding volume, morbidity, and hospital stay duration were analyzed.<br />RESULTS: All procedures were performed successfully, without intraoperative or major postoperative complications. The appendectomy portion of the procedure took approximately 20-30 minutes, with minimal blood loss. All patients were discharged, scar-free, 3 d after surgery.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Transvaginal appendectomy with gasless laparoscopy after vaginal hysterectomy appears to be a feasible and safe modification of established techniques, with acceptable outcomes.","24095022","2014","1"
"1049","The diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine","OBJECTIVES: Acute mesenteric ischemia is an infrequent cause of abdominal pain in emergency department (ED) patients; however, mortality for this condition is high. Rapid diagnosis and surgery are key to survival, but presenting signs are often vague or variable, and there is no pathognomonic laboratory screening test. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature was performed to determine diagnostic test characteristics of patient symptoms, objective signs, laboratory studies, and diagnostic modalities to help rule in or out the diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia in the ED.<br />METHODS: In concordance with published guidelines for systematic reviews, the medical literature was searched for relevant articles. The Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) for systematic reviews was used to evaluate the overall quality of the trials included. Summary estimates of diagnostic accuracy were computed by using a random-effects model to combine studies. Those studies without data to fully complete a two-by-two table were not included in the meta-analysis portion of the project.<br />RESULTS: The literature search identified 1,149 potentially relevant studies, of which 23 were included in the final analysis. The quality of the diagnostic studies was highly variable. A total of 1,970 patients were included in the combined population of all included studies. The prevalence of acute mesenteric ischemia ranged from 8% to 60%. There was a pooled sensitivity for l-lactate of 86% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 73% to 94%) and a pooled specificity of 44% (95% CI = 32% to 55%). There was a pooled sensitivity for D-dimer of 96% (95% CI = 89% to 99%) and a pooled specificity of 40% (95% CI = 33% to 47%). For computed tomography (CT), we found a pooled sensitivity of 94% (95% CI = 90% to 97%) and specificity of 95% (95% CI = 93% to 97%). The positive likelihood ratio (+LR) for a positive CT was 17.5 (95% CI = 5.99 to 51.29), and the negative likelihood ratio (-LR) was 0.09 (95% CI = 0.05 to 0.17). The pooled operative mortality rate for mesenteric ischemia was 47% (95% CI = 40% to 54%). Given these findings, the test threshold of 2.1% (below this pretest probability, do not test further) and a treatment threshold of 74% (above this pretest probability, proceed to surgical management) were calculated.<br />CONCLUSIONS: The quality of the overall literature base for mesenteric ischemia is varied. Signs, symptoms, and laboratory testing are insufficiently diagnostic for the condition. Only CT angiography had adequate accuracy to establish the diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia in lieu of laparotomy.","24238311","2013","11"
"1050","Pancreaticothoracic fistula presenting with hemoptysis and pneumothorax in a chronic alcoholic patient.","Tuberculosis and respiratory diseases","Pancreaticothoracic fistula is a rare complication of acute or chronic alcoholic pancreatitis. It may present with various symptoms, like dyspnea, abdominal pain, cough, chest pain, fever, back pain, hemoptysis, fatigue, or orthopnea. Pancreaticothoracic fistula can be detected by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), or computed tomography. MRCP has high sensitivity and fewer side effects, and thus it has recently been recommended as the first choice for the detection of pancreaticothoracic fistula. On the other hand, ERCP enables the detection and treatment of pancreaticothoracic fistula and allows for stent insertion; for this reason it is a commonly used modality in pancreaticothoracic fistula cases. Herein, the authors describe a case of pancreaticothoracic fistula detected by ERCP and MRCP that manifested only respiratory symptoms, namely hemoptysis and pneumothorax without abdominal pain, which commonly accompanies pancreatitis.","24920952","2014","5"

Atypical presentation with postemetic epigastralgia and pleural effusion usually leads physicians to make the diagnosis of Boerhaave syndrome. Herein, we report a 32-year-old woman who was diagnosed with Boerhaave syndrome initially after presenting with acute postemetic epigastralgia and predominant left side pleural effusion. Diagnostic left thoracentesis yielded bloody fluid with similar amylase level to serum. The chest computed tomographic scan showed no evidence of esophageal rupture. However, a ruptured celiac artery aneurysm with retroperitoneal hematoma extending to the posterior mediastinum and bilateral pleural space was found incidentally. Although ruptured celiac artery aneurysm is an uncommon cause for postemetic epigastralgia, acute vascular events such as the previously stated cause should be the first impression rather than Boerhaave syndrome if the patient also presents with isolated pleural effusion containing unelevated amylase.","23773770","2013","9"

"1054","Middle aortic coarctation.","Annals of vascular surgery","BACKGROUND: Middle aortic coarctation (MAC), a variant of middle aortic syndrome, is a rare entity with only âˆ¼200 cases described in the literature. It classically presents with early onset and refractory hypertension, abdominal angina, and lower extremity claudication. Although endovascular repair has been described for focal stenoses, open bypass remains the standard to restore abdominal inflow and correct renovascular hypertension.<br />METHODS: We describe an unusually late presentation of MAC in a 52-year-old man from El Salvador with refractory hypertension since age 8 requiring 5 antihypertensive medications. He presented with acute chest pain and severe hypertension. He denied mesenteric and peripheral vascular symptoms. Distal pulses were not palpable. Creatinine was 1.9Â mg/dL (peak 4.0Â mg/dL). Computed tomography angiography demonstrated coarctation of the descending thoracic aorta with extensive collateralization.<br />RESULTS: After control of blood pressure, the patient's singular anatomy dictated a descending thoracic aorta-infrarenal aortic bypass using a 16-mm woven Hemashield tube graft via a left fifth-interspace anterolateral thoracotomy and left retroperitoneal incision. The graft was tunneled through the posterior left hemidiaphragm. Patient had excellent recovery, with decrease in antihypertensive medications (5 to 2), restoration of all distal pulses, and no neurologic complications. Postoperative creatinine was 0.9Â mg/dL.<br />CONCLUSIONS: MACs are rare entities with presentation usually in youth or adolescence, comprising only 0.5-2% of all aortic coarctation cases. Etiologies include congenital, acquired, inflammatory, and infectious causes. If untreated, most patients do not survive past the fourth decade because of the sequelae of renovascular hypertension including myocardial infarction, heart failure, intracranial hemorrhage, and aortic rupture. Depending on technical considerations, open surgical bypass remains the standard repair for MAC.","24361384","2014","7"

With occurrence of thrombocytopaenia, it signals for several potentially lethal conditions such as complete or partial HELLP syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura and acute fatty liver of pregnancy.<br />CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 27-year-old, Sinhala ethnic primigravida with pregnancy-induced hypertension was admitted at 38 weeks of gestation with lower abdominal pain and a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg. She underwent emergency Caesarian section due to faetal distress giving birth to a healthy baby girl. Since postpartum day one, she was having intermittent fever spikes. All the routine investigations were normal in the first three weeks. Platelet count started dropping from post-partum day-20 onwards. On day-23, she had developed a seizure and computed tomography scan brain showed a subdural haemorrhage. She had a platelet count of 22,000 Ã— 109/liter and was managed conservatively. She also had elevated liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase and bilirubin levels. Blood picture on day-24 showed haemolytic anemia. On day- 36, patient again developed seizures and she was having intermittent fever with generalized headache and signs of meningism. Computed tomography scan revealed an acute on chronic subdural haemorrhage.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy should be managed as high-risk throughout the postpartum period. Development of thrombocytopaenia can be considered as an early warning sign for HELLP, thrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura or acute fatty liver of pregnancy which are lethal conditions. Prompt recognition of intracranial haemorrhages and early neurosurgical intervention is lifesaving.","24972626","2014",\N

Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has improved survival on peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) from appendiceal cancer. We hypothesize that tumoral high expression of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) is a negative prognostic factor for survival in patients with PC from appendiceal cancer.<br />METHODS: A retrospective study of a prospective database revealed 89 patients with PC from appendiceal cancer who underwent 127 CRS/HIPECs. Surgical specimens from 59 patients were tested to identify high vs. low VEGFR-2 expression. Patient outcomes and survival were analyzed.<br />RESULTS: There were 26 males and 33 females. Mean age was 51 years. Forty-seven VEGFR-2 high expressers and 15 low expressers were identified. Mean follow-up of high and low expressers was 25.1 and 26.6 months, respectively (p = 0.806). At follow-up, 33 (70%) high expressers were alive and 14 (30%) deceased, while 11 (92%) low expressers were alive and 1 (8%) deceased. Recurrence, use of bevacizumab, CC score, PCI, and LN status showed no differences between high and low expressers. OS for high expressers was 90.5%, 59.8%, and 47.1% at 1-, 3-, and 5-years, respectively, while OS for low expressers remained stable at 91.7% at 1-, 3-, and 5-years (p = 0.133).<br />CONCLUSION: There is a trend towards better outcomes and survival in patients with PC from appendiceal cancer who have low expression of VEGFR-2 compared to high expression.

"1059","Clinical information on admission is insufficient to determine the appropriate isolation regimen for acute gastroenteritis.","Danish medical journal","INTRODUCTION: The number of admissions for acute gastroenteritis (GE) is increasing. The majority of patients pass through a single high-flow emergency department (ED) area which increases the risk of spreading GE. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and aetiology of GE for acutely admitted patients and to analyse their clinical information focusing on risk indicators of contagious aetiology and on the chosen isolation regime to determine if the GE required a contact precaution isolation regime.<br />MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study included patients above 16 years of age who were admitted acutely within a one-year study period to a Danish hospital with a catchment population of 231,000 persons. The following items were analysed: information from the referring doctor, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting and fever history, abdominal pain, prior antibiotics, co-morbidity, drugs, travel history, contagious contacts, general condition, vital values, isolation regime, final diagnosis and results of stool examination.<br />RESULTS: Among 17,531 acute admissions, 1.6% had acute GE and 60% of these had stool examinations performed. Only 35% of the patients with GE had information about possible GE at referral. Short duration and vomiting may help to identify norovirus and antibiotic treatment within the last month to identify Clostridium difficile infections. All patients with highly infective GE were isolated under a contact precaution regime, but only one in four of the isolated patients were actually highly contagious.<br />CONCLUSION: Acute GE is a prevalent condition in the ED; a number of patients are isolated unnecessarily, but it is difficult to assess correctly who should be isolated and who should not. We recommend that further studies be undertaken to define isolation criteria and to assess the usefulness of new rapid analysis modalities with a view to reducing the isolation period.<br />FUNDING: not relevant.<br />TRIAL REGISTRATION: not relevant.","24947622","2014","6"

Although the principles of exposure management remain unchanged, recommended HIV postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimens and the duration of HIV follow-up testing for exposed personnel have been updated. This report emphasizes the importance of primary prevention strategies, the prompt reporting and management of occupational exposures, adherence to recommended HIV PEP regimens when indicated for an exposure, expert consultation in management of exposures, follow-up of exposed HCP to improve adherence to PEP, and careful monitoring for adverse events related to treatment, as well as for virologic, immunologic, and serologic signs of infection. To ensure timely postexposure management and administration of HIV PEP, clinicians should consider occupational exposures as urgent medical concerns, and institutions should take steps to ensure that staff are aware of both the importance of and the institutional mechanisms available for reporting and seeking care for such exposures. The following is a summary of recommendations: (1) PEP is recommended when occupational exposures to HIV occur; (2) the HIV status of the exposure source patient should be determined, if possible, to guide need for HIV PEP; (3) PEP medication regimens should be started as soon as possible after occupational exposure to HIV, and they should be continued for a 4-week duration; (4) new recommendation-PEP medication regimens should contain 3 (or more) antiretroviral drugs (listed in Appendix A ) for all occupational exposures to HIV; (5) expert consultation is recommended for any occupational exposures to HIV and at a minimum for situations described in Box 1 ; (6) close follow-up for exposed personnel ( Box 2 ) should be provided that includes counseling, baseline and follow-up HIV testing, and monitoring for drug toxicity; follow-up appointments should begin within 72 hours of an HIV exposure; and (7) new recommendation-if a newer fourth-generation combination HIV p24 antigen-HIV antibody test is utilized for follow-up HIV testing of exposed HCP, HIV testing may be concluded 4 months after exposure ( Box 2 ); if a newer testing platform is not available, follow-up HIV testing is typically concluded 6 months after an HIV exposure.","23917901","2013","9"

The median operating time was 59Â min (range 35-140). The median length of postoperative hospital stay was 4Â days (range 2-12). None of the cases were converted to open appendectomy. There were no perioperative surgical complications.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Our novel technique, gasless TUSILAA, is safe and feasible with acceptable operative time and excellent cosmetic result. Furthermore, this procedure has the advantage of cost-effectiveness since any disposable instruments including trocars, staplers, or expensive devices are not required. Therefore, this could be used as the first-choice surgical procedure for selected patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis.","24449261","2014","3"

"1072","[Appendicovesical fistula treated with elective laparoscopic surgery].","Cirugia y cirujanos","BACKGROUND: appendicovesical fistula is a rare complication of advanced acute appendicitis and represents a rare type of enterovesical fistula. Its symptoms are vague and imprecise and its diagnosis is difficult, requiring a high level of suspicion. Exploratory laparotomy has been the key for diagnosis and definitive treatment for many years, but recently the laparoscopic approach is standing out among different experienced groups as the method of choice.<br />CLINICAL CASE: we report a new case of appendicovesical fistula in a 45 year old female, who was remitted from Urology with symptoms of persistent dysuria and pyuria. She was finally diagnosed by computerized tomography and the appendicovesical fistula was resolved by laparoscopic surgery. This case adds to the one hundred and fifteen cases published so far and to the four treated by the laparoscopic approach.<br />DISCUSSION: conventional imaging methods are not reliable for the diagnosis of enterovesical fistula. Since most appendicovesical fistula are found to be secondary to non-diagnosed and advanced acute appendicitis in the majority of the consulted publications laparotomy is the key for the diagnosis of apendicovesical fistula. However laparoscopy is described as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool in few articles. We only found three articles in the literature referring to the laparoscopic approach as a therapeutic option.<br />CONCLUSION: computerized tomography is the diagnostic method of choice when communication between the digestive tract and urinary tract is suspected, particularly if the suspected fistula is an appendicovesical one. The laparoscopic approach of an appendicovesical fistula is able to confirm the radiological diagnosis and provide a definitive treatment.","25063901",\N,\N

Primary falciform ligament is very rare. In this article, we present a case of an isolated falciform ligament necrosis, a rare primary pathology of the falciform ligament, who was admitted with acute abdomen.<br />CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old female patient was admitted with the complaints of pain. Laboratory test results showed a leukocyte count of 17,000/mm(3). Imaging studies demonstrated intra-abdominal reactionary fluid along with a heterogeneous mass localized in the falciform ligament. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a necrotic mass of the falciform ligament. No other pathology responsible for falciform ligament necrosis was found. We believe that falciform ligament necrosis should be considered a preliminary diagnosis, if any ligament abnormality, tumor, intraligament air density, or the presence of reactionary fluid surrounding the ligament is detected through abdominal imaging studies.","25045547","2014",\N

"1077","Mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns released by abdominal trauma suppress pulmonary immune responses.","The journal of trauma and acute care surgery","BACKGROUND: Historically, fever, pneumonia, and sepsis after trauma are ascribed to pain and poor pulmonary toilet. No evidence supports that assertion however, and no known biologic mechanisms link injury to infection. Our studies show that injured tissues release mitochondria (MT). Mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns (mtDAMPs) however can mimic bacterial pathogen-associated danger molecules and attract neutrophils (PMN). We hypothesized that mtDAMPs from traumatized tissue divert neutrophils from the lung, causing susceptibility to infection.<br />METHODS: Anesthetized rats (6-10 per group) underwent pulmonary contusion (PC) by chest percussion. When modeling traumatic MT release, some rats had MT isolated from the liver (equal to 5% liver necrosis) injected intraperitoneally (IPMT). Negative controls had PC plus buffer intraperitoneally. Positive controls underwent PC plus cecal ligation and puncture. At 16 hours, bronchoalveolar and peritoneal lavages were performed. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peritoneal lavage fluid were assayed for PMN count, albumin, interleukin Î², (IL-Î²), and CINC-1. Assays were normalized to blood urea nitrogen to calculate absolute concentrations.<br />RESULTS: PC caused alveolar IL-1Î² and CINC production and a 34-fold increase in BALF neutrophils. As expected, IPMT increased peritoneal IL-1Î² and CINC and attracted PMN to the abdomen. However, remarkably, IPMT after PC attenuated BALF cytokine accumulation and decreased BALF PMN. Cecal ligation and puncture had no direct effect on BALF PMNs but, like IPMT, blunted BALF leukocytosis after PC.<br />CONCLUSION: Rather than acting as a \"second hit\" to enhance PMN-mediated lung injury, mtDAMPs from trauma and pathogen-associated danger molecules from peritoneal infection diminish PMN accumulation in a contused lung. This may make the lung susceptible to pneumonia. This paradigm provides a novel mechanistic model of the relationship among blunt tissue trauma, systemic inflammation, and pneumonia that can be studied to improve trauma outcomes.","24747452","2014","5"

The tests of water content, ash and ethanol-soluble extractives of V. radiata were carried out according to the methods recoded in appendix of Chinese Pharmacopeia (2010 edition, volume 1). The TLC method was established by using vitexin and isovitexin as references, and a mixture of acetate-method-water (10: 1.7 : 1.3) as the developing solvent system on GF254 thin layer plate. The contents of vitexin and isovitexin were determined by HPLC on a Prevail C18 (4.6 mm x 250 mm, 5 microm) column, using acetonitrile: water (23 : 77) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 mL x min(-1). The column temperature is 30 degrees C and the detection wavelength is 337 nm. As a result, vitexin, isovitexin and the other constituents were well separated on TLC detected under the UV light (254 nm).

The purpose of this study is to increase awareness of appendiceal neoplasms and appendicovesical fistulas. We reported our experiences in three complex cases related to digestive and urological systems, and reviewed the literature on diagnosis with various X-ray imaging techniques for this lesion. In this report, the first case failed to be diagnosed. The other two patients with appendicovesical fistulas secondary to appendiceal adenocarcinomas were successfully detected with computed tomography (CT) and cystoscopy. The patients recovered after right hemicolectomies and en bloc partial cystectomies and survived without tumor metastasis up to 7-year follow-up. In conclusion, a combined use of CT imaging and endoscopy techniques provides an accurate diagnostic alternative for appendicovesical fistula secondary to appendiceal adenocarcinoma.","25080116","2014",\N
"1084","Physical working capacity at fatigue threshold (PWCFT) is associated with sarcopenia-related body composition and measures of functionality in older adults.","Archives of gerontology and geriatrics","The relationship between PWCFT and common measures used to assess sarcopenia in older adults were examined. Fifty-eight older adults [age: 71.1 Â± 6.2 years; body mass index (BMI): 28.0 Â± 5.4 kg/m(2)] completed the testing procedures. Sarcopenia-related body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and participants performed a discontinuous cycle ergometry test to determine PWCFT. Functionality assessments included maximal isometric grip strength (GRIP) and sit-to-stand (STS) repetitions in 30s. Muscle quality (MQ) was defined as GRIP relative to appendicular lean soft tissue (ALM), while skeletal muscle index (SMI) was defined as ALM/height(2). Pearson correlations were used to examine the relationships among dependent variables. PWCFT showed significant relationships with ALM (r=0.57), SMI (r=0.47), body fat percentage (BF%) (r=-0.50), GRIP (r=0.49), and STS (r=0.44). For follow-up analyses, study participants were categorized into low sarcopenia risk (n=31) or high sarcopenia risk (n=27) groups by SMI. Sarcopenia risk was associated with PWCFT [odds ratio (OR): 1.051, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.016-1.087] and STS (OR: 1.305, CI: 1.060-1.607), but not GRIP (OR: 1.098, CI: 0.989-1.218). Using receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis, both PWCFT [area under the curve (AUC): 0.737, CI: 0.608-0.866, optimal cutoff: 37.5 W] and STS (AUC: 0.749, CI: 0.623-0.874, optimal cutoff: 12.5 repetitions) showed discriminative ability with regard to sarcopenia risk. The current data suggest that the neuromuscular fatigue threshold, as measured by PWCFT, is related to measures of body composition and function in older adults.","24856645",\N,\N

We evaluated the potential efficacy of different drugs for initial treatment of this condition, as recommended by recent Consensus Conference and Guidelines for paediatric patients. Susceptibility to ampicillin-sulbactam, ertapenem, gentamycin, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, vancomycin, and teicoplanin was evaluated according to EUCST 2012 recommendations in aerobic bacteria isolated from peritoneal fluid in CASP diagnosed from 2005 to 2011 at 'Istituto Giannina Gaslini', Genoa, Italy. A total of 114 strains were analysed: 83 E. coli, 15 P. aeruginosa, 6 Enterococci, and 10 other Gram-negatives. Resistance to ampicillin-sulbactam was detected in 37% of strains, while ertapenem showed a potential resistance of 13% (all P. aeruginosa strains). However, the combination of these drugs with gentamicin would have been increased the efficacy of the treatment to 99 and 100%, respectively. Resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam was 3%, while no strain was resistant to meropenem. Our data suggest that monotherapy with ampicillin-sulbactam or ertapenem for community-acquired secondary peritonitis would present a non-negligible rate of failure, but the addition of gentamycin to these drugs could reset to zero this risk. On the contrary, monotherapy with piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem is highly effective.","23906074","2013","8"

"1090","Some economic aspects of recreational injuries.","The Australian journal of physiotherapy","This paper deals with some basic features of accidents in recreation and will attempt to throw some light on their economic consequences. Let us examine sport as one aspect of recreation. As Williams (1973) put it, \"Sport is a phenomenon of simple definition, but with well recognised features. It is essentially recreational, essentially physical, frequently competitive and always contrived.\" The number and type of participants has increased, along with the range of activities available. Classifications of sport, at best, are arbitrary but nevertheless are useful for analysis. These divisions may be land/air/water types; indoor/outdoor; team/individual; body contact/non-contact/vehicular; amateur/professional. Sports injuries are of two types, intrinsic or self-inflicted (Williams, 1973) and extrinsic. Intrinsic injuries refer to those as a result of over-use (leading, for example, to stress fractures) and to specific incidents not involving outside agents. Extrinsic injuries are caused by contact with external objects and form the bulk of injuries sustained in body-contact, vehicular (horses, cars, skis) and environmental-type sports. Extrinsic injuries are generally more severe because greater forces and velocities are involved. Appendix 1 lists the main sporting activities according to location of sport; individual or team participation; likelihood of extensive body contact; and professional status. Professional players not only suffer loss of earning capacity but may reflect a bad investment for an entrepreneur or reduce spectator attendance and gate taking. It is apparent that team sports, having substantial body contact, face a higher risk of moderate to serious injury than do individual, non-contact sports, although major injuries can be sustained in the latter, for example, sprains and dislocations in athletics, golf, tennis, etc. Other sports must be classed as dangerous because of the nature of competition, for example, motor racing and flying. These particulars were collated during a survey on economic aspects of sport undertaken by the author in 1971-72 in Queensland. Some indication of the proportion of sport participants in the total Queensland population is given in Table 1.","25026233","1974","6"
"1091","Patient-Reported Outcome Measures in Safety Event Reporting: PROSPER Consortium guidance.","Drug safety","The Patient-Reported Outcomes Safety Event Reporting (PROSPER) Consortium was convened to improve safety reporting by better incorporating the perspective of the patient. PROSPER comprises industry, regulatory authority, academic, private sector and patient representatives who are interested in the area of patient-reported outcomes of adverse events (PRO-AEs). It has developed guidance on PRO-AE data, including the benefits of wider use and approaches for data capture and analysis. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) encompass the full range of self-reporting, rather than only patient reports collected by clinicians using validated instruments. In recent years, PROs have become increasingly important across the spectrum of healthcare and life sciences. Patient-centred models of care are integrating shared decision making and PROs at the point of care; comparative effectiveness research seeks to include patients as participatory stakeholders; and industry is expanding its involvement with patients and patient groups as part of the drug development process and safety monitoring. Additionally, recent pharmacovigilance legislation from regulatory authorities in the EU and the USA calls for the inclusion of patient-reported information in benefit-risk assessment of pharmaceutical products. For patients, technological advancements have made it easier to be an active participant in one's healthcare. Simplified internet search capabilities, electronic and personal health records, digital mobile devices, and PRO-enabled patient online communities are just a few examples of tools that allow patients to gain increased knowledge about conditions, symptoms, treatment options and side effects. Despite these changes and increased attention on the perceived value of PROs, their full potential has yet to be realised in pharmacovigilance. Current safety reporting and risk assessment processes remain heavily dependent on healthcare professionals, though there are known limitations such as under-reporting and discordant perspectives between patient reports and clinician perceptions of adverse outcomes. PROSPER seeks to support the wider use of PRO-AEs. The scope of this guidance document, which was completed between July 2011 and March 2013, considered a host of domains related to PRO-AEs, including definitions and suitable taxonomies, the range of datasets that could be used, data collection mechanisms, and suitable analytical methodologies. PROSPER offers an innovative framework to differentiate patient populations. This framework considers populations that are prespecified (such as those in clinical trials, prospective observational studies and some registries) and non-prespecified populations (such as those in claims databases, PRO-enabled online patient networks, and social websites in general). While the main focus of this guidance is on post-approval PRO-AEs from both prespecified and non-prespecified population groups, PROSPER has also considered pre-approval, prespecified populations. The ultimate aim of this guidance is to ensure that the patient 'voice' and perspective feed appropriately into collection of safety data. The guidance also covers a minimum core dataset for use by industry or regulators to structure PRO-AEs (accessible in the online appendix) and how data, once collected, might be evaluated to better inform on the safe and effective use of medicinal products. Structured collection of such patient data can be considered both a means to an end (improving patient safety) as well as an end in itself (expressing the patient viewpoint). The members of the PROSPER Consortium therefore direct this PRO-AE guidance to multiple stakeholders in drug safety, including industry, regulators, prescribers and patients. The use of this document across the entirety of the drug development life cycle will help to better define the benefit-risk profile of new and existing medicines. Because of the clinical relevance of 'real-world' data, PROs have the potential to contribute important new knowledge about the benefits and risks of medicinal products, communicated through the voice of the patient.","24092596","2013","12"

Presarcopenia was defined as an SMI of â‰¤7.26â€‰kg/m(2) for males and â‰¤5.5â€‰kg/m(2) for females. Biochemical and anthropometric measurements were done using standardized procedures.<br />RESULTS: The 152 participants included 68 women (44.7%). Mean age was 44Â±9 years (range, 28-67 years), and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 25.7Â±3.8â€‰kg/m(2). The prevalence rates of presarcopenia among individuals with and without diabetes were 39.5% and 15.8%, respectively (P=0.001). The mean SMI values were significantly lower in those with diabetes (6.84Â±1.02â€‰kg/m(2)) compared with participants without diabetes (7.28Â±1.01â€‰kg/m(2)) (P=0.009). SMI showed a positive correlation with BMI and waist circumference but a negative correlation with age, fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and low-density lipoprotien cholesterol in the total study population. Logistic regression analysis showed that diabetes was independently associated with presarcopenia (P=0.001).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of presarcopenia is higher among Asian Indian subjects with type 2 diabetes compared with age- and sex-matched participants without diabetes.","23789632","2013","9"

However, developmental abnormalities may interfere with the preoperative diagnosis and surgical treatment in some cases. Agenesis and atresia of the cecal vermiform appendix is an extremely rare clinical diagnosis. In addition, preoperative diagnosis may be difficult in some cases. Thus, diagnosis of the congenital absence of the vermiform appendix requires a thorough exploration of the retrocecal and ileocecal regions. A 59-year-old male was admitted from the emergency services with right lower abdominal pain. A celiotomy was performed with the suspicion of acute appendicitis. However, an atresia of the vermiform appendix was observed. The patient's appendix was thus removed. Pathological examination confirmed suppurative appendicitis. This case underlines the importance of the clinical entity for surgeons who may deal with a similar case.","23326173","2013","1"
"1097","Standardized and quality-assured video-recorded examination in undergraduate education: informed consent prior to surgery.","The Journal of surgical research","BACKGROUND: Communication skills combined with specialized knowledge are fundamental to the doctor-patient relationship in surgery. During a single-station video-recorded objective structured clinical examination (VOSCE), students were tasked with obtaining informed consent. Our aim was to develop a standardized and quality-assured assessment method in undergraduate education.<br />METHODS: One hundred fifty-five students in their fifth year of medical school (78 videos) participated in a summative VOSCE within the framework of the teaching module \"Operative Medicine.\" They prepared for three clinical scenarios and the surgical procedures involved. The examination comprised participants having to obtain informed consent from simulated patients, video recording their performance. Students were assessed by two independent raters, the background of one of whom was nonsurgical. Results were statistically tested using SPSS.<br />RESULTS: Students' scores were all beyond the pass mark of 70%, averaging 91.0% (Â±4.0%), 88.4% (Â±4.4%), and 87.0% (Â±4.7%) for the appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and inguinal hernia repair checklist, respectively. Most items (68%-89% of the checklists) were found to have fair to excellent discrimination values. Cronbach's Î± values ranged between 0.565 and 0.605 for the individual checklists. Interrater agreement was strong (Pearson correlation coefficientÂ =Â 0.80, PÂ <Â 0.01; intraclass correlation coefficient 2.1Â =Â 0.78).<br />CONCLUSIONS: The VOSCE is both feasible and reliable as a method of assessing student communication skills and the application of clinical knowledge while obtaining informed consent in surgery.

Morbidity and mortality weekly report","In December 2012, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved VariZIG, a varicella zoster immune globulin preparation (Cangene Corporation, Winnipeg, Canada) for use in the United States for postexposure prophylaxis of varicella for persons at high risk for severe disease who lack evidence of immunity to varicella* and for whom varicella vaccine is contraindicated. Previously available under an investigational new drug (IND) expanded access protocol, VariZIG, a purified immune globulin preparation made from human plasma containing high levels of anti-varicella-zoster virus antibodies (immunoglobulin G), is the only varicella zoster immune globulin preparation currently available in the United States. VariZIG is now approved for administration as soon as possible following varicella-zoster virus exposure, ideally within 96 hours (4 days) for greatest effectiveness. CDC recommends administration of VariZIG as soon as possible after exposure to the varicella-zoster virus and within 10 days. CDC also has revised the patient groups recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to receive VariZIG by extending the period of eligibility for previously recommended premature infants from exposures to varicella-zoster virus during the neonatal period to exposures that occur during the entire period for which they require hospital care for their prematurity. The CDC recommendations for VariZIG use are now harmonized with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendations. This report summarizes data on the timing of administration of varicella zoster immune globulin in relation to exposure to varicella-zoster virus and provides the CDC updated recommendations for use of VariZIG that replace the 2007 ACIP recommendations.","23863705","2013","7"
"1099","Transvaginal hybrid-NOTES appendectomy in routine clinical use: prospective analysis of 13 cases and description of the procedure.","Surgical endoscopy","BACKGROUND: Access-related abdominal wall injury is part of the operative trauma in laparoscopic appendectomy and accounts for complications. Minimizing this trauma by entering the abdominal cavity by means of natural orifice transluminal surgery (NOTES) may be achieved by a hybrid-appendectomy procedure using the transvaginal route plus a single transumbilical trocar.<br />METHODS: Thirteen patients were prospectively analyzed following transvaginal-hybrid NOTES appendectomy. For the procedure, rigid instruments are used with the patient in lithotomy position. The procedure is performed with two transvaginal and one transumbilical access-points. The specimen is retrieved transvaginally.<br />RESULTS: All procedures were performed without additional trocars. No conversions to standard laparoscopy or open surgery were necessary. All procedures were performed in acceptable time (mean 52Â min). No intraoperative complications and two (15%) postoperative complications, an infected hematoma and an abscess, occurred. They were smoothly treated with standard techniques including one laparoscopic reoperation (8%). Drain placement or resection of a Meckel's diverticulum was easily managed without conversion. Gynecological short-term follow-up revealed one complication, which was vaginal fungal infection. It occurred after a 7-day course of antibiotics.<br />CONCLUSION: This method is found to be feasible intraoperatively and early postoperatively in terms of possibility to manage a variety of intraoperative findings that may occur during planned appendectomy, low intraoperative complications, and management of postoperative complications using established concepts. We, therefore, consider the procedure safe and continue to offer hybrid-NOTES appendectomy to suitable patients.","24718667","2014","9"

Loss-of-function mutations in the SLC22A12 gene cause renal hypouricemia type 1 (RHUC1), whereas renal hypouricemia type 2 (RHUC2) is caused by mutations in the SLC2A9 gene.<br />CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a 24-year-old Pakistani man who was admitted twice to our hospital for severe exercise-induced acute renal failure (EIARF), abdominal pain and fever; he had very low serum UA levels (0.2 mg/dl the first time and 0.09 mg/dl the second time) and high FE-UA (200% and 732% respectively), suggestive of RHUC. Mutational analyses of both urate transporters revealed a new compound heterozygosity for two distinct missense mutations in the SLC2A9 gene: p.Arg380Trp, already identified in heterozygosity, and p.Gly216Arg, previously found in homozygosity or compound heterozygosity in some RHUC2 patients. Compared with previously reported patients harbouring these mutations, our proband showed the highest FE-UA levels, suggesting that the combination of p.Arg380Trp and p.Gly216Arg mutations most severely affects the renal handling of UA.<br />CONCLUSIONS: The clinical and molecular findings from this patient and a review of the literature provide new insights into the genotype-phenotype correlation of this disorder, supporting the evidence of an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern for RHUC2. Further investigations into the functional properties of GLUT9, URAT1 and other urate transporters are required to assess their potential research and clinical implications.","24397858","2014",\N

A 85-year-old Caucasian male patient was referred to our department due to acute pain at the upper right quadrant, spreaded to the right shoulder blade. Patient had nausea and mild fever and Murphy's maneuver was positive. At physical examination a large bulky mass was found in the right flank. Patient underwent to US exam that detected a big stone in the lumen of the gallbladder and in correspondence of the palpable mass, an extended concentric thickening of the colic wall. CT scan was performed and confirmed a widespread and concentric thickening of the wall of the ascending colon and cecum. In addition, revealed signs of microperforation of the colic wall. Numerous large lymphadenopathies were found in the abdominal, pelvic and thoracic cavity and there was a condition of splenomegaly, with some ischemic outcomes in the context of the spleen. No metastasis in the parenchimatous organs were found. These imaging findings suggest us the diagnosis of lymphoma.

Its quick and correct diagnosis is indispensable for the further treatment of patients. The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical value of abdominal ultrasound performed with a modern hand-carried ultrasound (HCU) device as well as with a high-end ultrasound (HUS) system in the diagnosis of PP in patients with acute abdominal pain.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: 31 patients with acute abdominal pain were enrolled in this study irrespective of their underlying disease, and examination with a latest generation HCU and a newest generation HUS was performed. Diagnosis of PP was based on findings of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and abdominal radiography (AR) as the standard of reference. The study was carried out by two independent and experienced examiners unaware of the diagnosis made by MDCT or AR.<br />RESULTS: In five (16â€Š%) patients PP was identified by MDCT and AR. Examination with HCU was calculated with a sensitivity and specificity of 80â€Š% and 81â€Š%, respectively. Examination with HUS yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 80â€Š% and 89â€Š%, respectively.<br />CONCLUSION: PP can be detected by HCU and HUS with almost equal accuracy in patients with acute abdominal pain but both methods are inferior compared to MDCT and AR. However, HCU and HUS can accelerate the triage of patients and help to make decisions regarding the necessity of further examinations without the need for radiation and while reducing economic and logistic resources.<br />KEY POINTS: 1. Pneumoperitoneum (PP) is a severe finding in emergency departments. 2. Hand-carried (HCU) and high-end (HUS) ultrasound systems can be helpful in detecting PP. 3. Abdominal radiography (AR) and multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) are superior in detecting PP. 4. HCU and HUS can accelerate the triage of patients. 5.

Depending on the activity administered, the radiation dose to patients is about comparable to higher using (18)F-fluoride for bone imaging compared with conventional scintigraphy using 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate. In times of molybdenum shortage, (18)F-fluoride represents a good alternative to 99mTc-based bone tracers. Besides malignant skeletal disease(18)F-fluoride PET/CT has in the last decade been investigated in a variety of non-oncologic musculoskeletal disorders of all parts of the skeleton. Studies included imaging of the skull with a special focus on bisphosphonate-induced osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients treated with bisphosphonates due to benign or malignant bone changes. Further studies evaluated the appendicular skeleton with emphasis on postsurgical changes including patients after knee and hip surgery and patients having received bone grafts of their limbs. Also, therapeutic effect of (18)F-fluoride PET/CT on patients with unclear foot pain was investigated. Finally imaging of the axial skeleton was analyzed including patients with ankylosing spondylitis and with Paget disease as well as patients after spine surgery including assessment of cage incorporation after cervical and lumbar spine fusion surgery. Furthermore, children suspected of child abuse as well as young patients with back pain were investigated by either (18)F-fluoride PET or PET/CT. Regarding its favorable technical aspects as well as study results presented, it is imaginable that (18)F-fluoride PET/(CT) will be increasingly used for non-oncologic musculoskeletal imaging in the future either as an adjunct or alternative to so far established imaging modalities and seems to be promising regarding decision making in the therapeutic management of patients with non-oncologic musculoskeletal disorders.","24094710","2013","11"
"1106","Resolution of appendiceal colic following migration of an appendicolith.","Journal of visceral surgery","The presence of an appendiceal fecalith should not be considered as a categorical sign of acute appendicitis. The fecalith may, however, be responsible for abdominal pain--right lower quadrant tenderness without associated appendicitis, i.e. appendiceal colic. When a patient presents with right lower quadrant abdominal tenderness, abdomino-pelvic computerized tomography (CT) may establish this diagnosis by demonstrating the presence of the appendicolith but without evidence of appendiceal inflammation or infection. Spontaneous migration of the appendicolith may result in cure. In this previously unpublished clinical case, the CT demonstrates the spontaneous passage of the appendicolith, which coincided in time with the resolution of the abdominal pain syndrome. When a patient presents with typical symptoms of appendiceal colic and CT findings of an appendicolith without appendicitis, appendectomy will certainly relieve the pain. But if the stone passes spontaneously, the need for appendectomy is debatable, particularly in a high-risk patient.","24999228","2014","9"

Standard deviation of electromyographic activity of the external oblique (EO), transverse abdominis/internal oblique (TrA/IO), and erector spinae (ES) muscles onset relative to deltoid muscle onset was recorded in 75 rapid arm flexions, and the correlation with the participants' avoidance belief (the FABQ score) and disability (the Roland-Morris Questionnaire score) was statistically analyzed.<br />RESULTS: participants with LBP exhibited less variability in timing of APAs of the TrA/IO muscle compared with the control group (P=0.047). The timing of APAs of the TrA/IO muscle was significantly correlated with the FABQ score (P=0.006). There was no significant correlation between this variable and disability (P=0.09). Decrease in variability of the timing of APA of the EO (P=0.45) and ES (P=0.6) muscles was not significant.<br />CONCLUSION: The variability of the postural responses of participants with LBP decreased. Restoring variability in postural control responses might be a goal in rehabilitating these patients.","23948849","2014",\N

This is a diagnosis that, although uncommon, is important for emergency physicians to know about. The literature is relatively sparse.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective review of patients who were diagnosed with spontaneous ureteral rupture. From 2006 to 2012, 18 patients were diagnosed by radiography (computed tomography or intravenous urogram) with spontaneous ureteral rupture. These cases all showed extravasation of the contrast outside the excretory system. We evaluated underlying causes, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and outcomes.<br />RESULTS: There were 9 men and 9 women with a median age of 59 years (range, 22-82 years). In 56% of patients, a ureteral stone was the cause; in 17% of, a ureteral stricture; in 1 patient, a ureteral tumor; and in the remaining 22%, no cause was identified. In 13 patients (72.2%), primary ureteroscopy to place D-J stents was performed. The average duration of ureteral catheter stenting was 21 days (range, 8-45 days). The other 5 patients (27.8%) were managed conservatively with antibiotic treatment and the outcome was good.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Ureteral stones most commonly cause spontaneous ureteral rupture. In our experience, most patients received ureteroscopy and Double-J stenting. Conservative management with antibiotics also had good outcomes. Most patients had sudden onset of abdominal or flank pain. Spontaneous ureteral rupture should be kept in the differential diagnosis of patients with acute abdominal or flank pain in the emergency department.","24768334","2014","7"
"1110","Incidentally discovered goblet cell carcinoid clinically presenting as acute intestinal obstruction: a case report with review of literature.","Indian journal of pathology & microbiology","Goblet cell carcinoid (GCC) is a rare variant of carcinoid tumor that exclusively involves the appendix. It usually occurs in 5th-6th decade with the most common clinical presentation being acute appendicitis. The natural history of this tumor is intermediate between carcinoids and adenocarcinomas. We here report a case of GCC diagnosed incidentally in a patient presenting with acute intestinal obstruction. Ultrasonographic examination supported the clinical diagnosis of acute intestinal obstruction, following which the patient underwent laparotomy and resection of ileum along with appendix was done. On gross pathological examination, a nodular growth was present on the tip and body of appendix that was yellow in color with a semi-solid to mucoid consistency on cut section. On microscopy, lakes of mucin with few acinar structures floating in them were seen. The submucosa as well as serosa were infiltrated by clusters of goblet cells and well-formed acini, with little atypia. Glands and nests were positive for periodic acid Schiff and immunohistochemistry showed focal chromogranin positivity in glandular structures, thereby confirming the diagnosis of GCC. Although the prognosis of GCC is better than adenocarcinomas, it is one of the carcinoids having a poorer outcome when compared with other variants of carcinoid tumor. Therefore, it is important to rule out other differential diagnoses of goblet cell carcinoid, the most important being mucinous adenocarcinomas.","24739849",\N,\N

In this study, lean and fat mass, bone mineral density, knee extension and flexion strength and physical ability tests in healthy independent elderly women were investigated. Main determinants of lean mass, strength and physical ability were determined searching for predictors of healthy aging.<br />METHODS: A total of 100 healthy women aged â‰¥ 65 years considered independent and active were invited. Bone mass and body composition were assessed by DXA. The strength of the lower limb was assessed by isokinetic dynamometry, and physical ability was measured by: Timed Up and Go (TUG), Berg Balance Test (BBT) and Dynamic Gait Index (DGI).<br />RESULTS: Women were on average 70.8Â±4.92 years old, had BMI of 27.38Â±5.11 kg/m2 and fat mass of 26.96Â±9.62 kg or 40.65Â±8.06%. Total lean mass and appendicular lean mass (ALM) were 35.38Â±4.83 kg and 15.32Â±2.26 kg, respectively, while relative skeletal mass index (RSMI) was 6.51Â±0.77 kg/m2. Age did not correlate significantly with ALM. Age and ALM were the main determinants of the strength of the lower limb (p<0.001) while age and strength of the lower limb were significantly associated with the performance on the physical tests (p<0.001).<br />CONCLUSION: Age has a negative impact on the strength and the physical performance in independent healthy women without co-morbidities. Physical ability tests are positively influenced by the strength of the lower limb. These relationships suggest that muscle strength should be the parameter to be prioritized when preparing for healthy aging.","24886744","2014","5"

Survey items assessed current HIV screening practices and knowledge, attitudes, and perceived barriers towards screening. Provider demographics and practice characteristics were analyzed for associations with screening through logistic regression.<br />RESULTS: Of 190 PCPs, there were 101 evaluable responses (response rate: 53.2%). PCPs reported a screening rate for HIV of 39.6% (\"most\" or \"all of the time\") during routine adolescent visits compared with violence (60.4%), substance abuse (92.1%), and depression (94.1%) (P < .001). Less than 10% of PCPs correctly answered questions related to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state HIV screening recommendations. Of 20 potential HIV screening barriers assessed, mean number of reported barriers was 4.8 (SD Â± 2.9); with most concerns related to confidentiality, time for counseling, and follow-up. In a multivariable model, the only factor significantly associated with HIV screening \"most\" or \"all of the time\" during routine adolescent visits was urban practice site (aOR 9.8, 95% CI 2.9, 32.9). Provider type, sex, years since training, HIV screening guideline knowledge, and endorsing â‰¤5 barriers were not associated with HIV screening.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Although providers practicing in urban areas were more likely to report screening adolescents for HIV than those in suburban areas, overall self-reported screening rates were low, and several barriers were identified commonly. Future interventions should target increasing providers' knowledge and addressing concerns about confidentiality, requirements and counseling time, and follow-up of results.","24084105","2013","12"

Recently, we encountered a case of omental torsion diagnosed as omental infarction preoperatively. An 18-year-old male presented to our emergency room with a chief complaint of lower abdominal pain since previous 2 days. Because of his history of Down syndrome, an abdominal examination was very difficult. Plain abdominal computed tomography (CT) suggested omental hernia adhering to the right paracolic gutters. Two days after hospital admission, symptoms did not improve, and contrast-enhanced abdominal CT suggested omental infarction. We performed an emergency surgery. Upon exploration of the abdominal cavity, the greater omentum was found to be twisted four times and adhered to the right paracolic gutters. We performed a partial omentectomy. He was discharged 9 days after the surgery. There was no cause of omental torsion in the abdominal cavity, and he was diagnosed as having idiopathic omental torsion. In cases wherein the cause of acute abdomen cannot be detected, omental torsion should be considered, and abdominal CT could be helpful for the diagnosis.","24363947","2013",\N

Of 430 workers attending the meal, 56 were hospitalized with abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea, according to the initial report. We conducted an investigation to identify the extent, vehicle, and source of the outbreak. In our case-control study, a case was a worker who attended the meal and who was hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis; controls were randomly selected from non-ill workers. Cases and controls were interviewed using a standard questionnaire. We used logistic regression to calculate adjusted odds ratios for the consumption of food items. Catering service facilities and food handlers working for the service were inspected. Food samples from the catering service were tested at reference laboratories. Of hospitalized cases, 54 fulfilled the case definition, but no stool specimens were collected for laboratory testing. Of four food items served during lunch, only \"squash and pork soup\" was significantly associated with gastroenteritis, with an adjusted odds ratio of 9.5 (95 % CI 3.2, 27.7). The caterer did not separate cooked from raw foods but used the same counter for both. Cooked foods were kept at room temperature for about 4 h before serving.

"1116","Mucocele of the appendix due to endometriosis: a rare case report.","World journal of gastroenterology : WJG","Mucocele of the appendix due to endometriosis is extremely rare, and there are only 10 previously reported cases in the English literature. We report a case of mucocele of the appendix due to endometriosis and provide the first review of the literature. A 43-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of recurrent right lower abdominal pain during her menstrual periods. Colonoscopy revealed submucosal tumor-like elevations of the appendiceal orifice. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen suggested cystic lesions near the appendix. Consequently, mucocele of the appendix was suspected preoperatively. An open ileocecal resection was performed. Multiple cystic lesions were observed around the appendix. The cystic lesions contained mucus. Histopathological examination was consistent with a mucocele of the appendix due to endometriosis. The postoperative course was uneventful. We present the first review of the literature to clarify the clinical features.","23946611","2013","8"

Only those having undergone a bone scintigraphy (BS) were included in this retrospective study.<br />RESULTS: Sixteen girls and 8 boys with a mean age of 7 years were studied. Bone scintigraphy was positive in 6 (25%), but only 2 had bone pain. Axial involvement was present in all 6 patients, and appendicular lesions in 3 of them. Three patients had a BS control, with improvement or normalization after treatment with antibiotics.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Bone involvement occurs infrequently in patients with cat scratch disease and is not always associated with specific signs. Cat scratch disease must be suspected in patients with fever of unknown origin presenting multifocal lesions on BS.","24152635","2013","12"
"1119","Imaging of oncologic emergencies: what every radiologist should know.","Radiographics : a review publication of the Radiological Society of North America, Inc","Acute life-threatening conditions in oncology patients may develop either because of underlying malignancy or as a complication from treatment. Oncologic emergencies can be categorized as metabolic, hematologic, and structural conditions. Metabolic and hematologic emergencies are mainly diagnosed on the basis of clinical and laboratory findings. Structural pathologic conditions that result in bleeding, mechanical compression, or obstruction to the hollow organs, such as the trachea and bowel loops, may first be suspected because of clinical findings, including decreasing hematocrit levels, difficulty in breathing, and abdominal pain; however, performance of imaging studies is critical for timely diagnosis and management. Life-threatening conditions of the central nervous system (such as cerebral herniation, carcinomatous meningitis, and spinal cord compression), thoracic emergent conditions (such as central airway obstruction, esophagorespiratory fistula, massive hemoptysis, pulmonary embolism, superior vena cava syndrome, and pericardial tamponade), and abdominopelvic emergencies (such as uncontrolled intraabdominal hemorrhage, bowel obstruction, intestinal perforation, bowel ischemia, intussusception, and urinary tract obstruction) can be definitively diagnosed on the basis of projectional or cross-sectional imaging findings in appropriate clinical scenarios. Select emergent conditions in cancer patients related to chemotherapy and radiation treatment, as well as iatrogenic emergencies secondary to either surgery or placement of central venous catheters, may also demonstrate characteristic findings at imaging studies. In addition, interventional procedures are of great help in the treatment of acute superior vena cava syndrome, massive hemoptysis, and uncontrolled intraabdominal hemorrhage. Radiologists should be aware of these select, \"not to be missed\" imaging findings of oncologic emergencies to make an accurate, timely diagnosis and provide appropriate patient care.","24108550","2013","10"

"1122","Extraumbilical single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy with standard laparoscopic instruments.","Scandinavian journal of surgery : SJS : official organ for the Finnish Surgical Society and the Scandinavian Surgical Society","BACKGROUND AND AIM: Single-incision laparoscopic surgery is a rapidly progressing field as it combines some advantages such as cosmesis and less incisional pain. However, it also has some disadvantages such as limitation of movement and clashing of the hand instruments, which increase the complexity and technical challenges of the operation. In this study, we describe a pilot trial of single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy through a paramedian access site.<br />MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 25 patients underwent single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy with this method. Acute cases with empyema and patients with history of previous abdominal surgery were excluded. Single-incision is established on the right upper quadrant, right latero-superior of the umbilicus, so that trocar sites and projection of the gallbladder on the abdominal wall are on the same vertical line. Standard laparoscopic instruments were placed into the abdominal cavity providing triangulation. Once the laparoscope, grasper, and dissector are in place, the overall procedures are similar to the standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy.<br />RESULTS: Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy through an extraumbilical access site was successfully completed in all 25 patients without conversion to open surgery. Additional skin incisions and trocar access were required only in two patients. The mean operative time was 39.3 min (range: 20-75 min). The mean body mass index was 27.2. Postoperative course was uneventful in all patients. The mean postoperative hospital stay was shorter than 24 h, and all patients were discharged at first day postoperatively. No postoperative complications including seroma, wound infection, and trocar-site hernia were observed at 6-month follow-up.<br />CONCLUSION: We described a new access site for single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy using standard laparoscopic instruments. We believe that this type of access site overcomes the technical difficulties of performing single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and it is a promising alternative method for the treatment of patients with symptomatic gallstone disease as a minimal invasive abdominal surgery.","23963037","2013",\N

So far, schistosomiasis in travelers or expatriates returning from the Tanzanian bank of Lake Tanganyika has not been reported.<br />METHODS: We report a group of students who sought treatment with signs of acute schistosomiasis after having returned from Lake Tanganyika, Tanzania. Information as to travel and exposure as well as clinical and laboratory data were collected.<br />RESULTS: Schistosomiasis was diagnosed in 8 of 16 students from Berlin, Germany, who had returned from a 2- to 3-month stay of fieldwork in Kigoma District at Lake Tanganyika, Tanzania. All 16 students reported frequent freshwater exposure at the lake. Six patients showed signs of acute schistosomiasis and had fever, and some of them also had cough, weakness, headache, or abdominal pain. Eosinophilia was present in five of the six symptomatic individuals. Notably, two serologically enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-positive individuals did not report or present with symptoms or abnormal laboratory parameters. Schistosoma mansoni eggs were found in one symptomatic and one asymptomatic individual each. Blood and stool samples from the other eight individuals who were equally exposed to freshwater yielded negative results.<br />CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of an outbreak of acute schistosomiasis imported from the Tanzanian shore of Lake Tanganyika and highlights the risk for travelers and the local population of acquiring the infection in that part of Tanzania. It provides arguments for routine serological screening for schistosomiasis in individuals who had prior freshwater contact in endemic areas, irrespective of symptoms or other laboratory findings.","24112100",\N,\N

He presented with abdominal pain, and an abdominal CT demonstrated severe hydronephrosis and a large abdominal fluid collection presumed to be a CSFoma. The shunt was externalized, and fluid consistent with CSF was removed by aspiration of the shunt catheter at the time of surgery and by interventional radiology placement of a pigtail drain into the remaining fluid collection. Endoscopic evaluation of the Monti channel revealed evidence of healed perforation. A suprapubic catheter was placed and the Monti channel remained catheterized. The shunt was eventually converted to a ventriculoatrial shunt. A postoperative renal ultrasound later demonstrated marked improvement in the hydronephrosis and mild caliectasis. The suprapubic catheter and the indwelling Monti catheter were removed. The patient resumed catheterization of the Monti channel.<br />RESULT: Follow-up ultrasounds have shown stable, mild hydronephrosis, consistent with the patient's baseline.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Practitioners should have a high index of suspicion for potential shunt contamination and CSFoma development in patients with Monti channels and a history of difficult catheterization.","24249207","2014","6"

Chronic HF is accompanied by co-morbidities that influence the quality of life and outcomes.<br />METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively enrolled 200 patients with chronic HF. The appendicular skeletal muscle mass of the arms and the legs combined, was assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. We analysed the muscle strength in arms and legs, and all patients underwent a 6-min walk test, a 4-m walk test, and spiroergometry testing. Muscle wasting was defined as the appendicular muscle mass 2 SD below the mean of a healthy reference group of adults aged 18-40 years, as suggested for the diagnosis of muscle wasting in healthy ageing (sarcopenia). Muscle wasting was detected in 39 (19.5%) subjects. Patients with muscle wasting had significantly lower values for handgrip and quadriceps strength as well as lower total peak oxygen consumption (peakVO2, 1173 Â± 433 vs. 1622 Â± 456 mL/min), lower exercise time (7.7 Â± 3.8 vs. 10.22 Â± 3.0 min, both P < 0.001), and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, P = 0.05) than patients without. The distance walked during 6 min and the gait speed during the 4-m walk were lower in patients with muscle wasting (both P < 0.05). Serum levels of interleukin-6 were significantly elevated in patients with muscle wasting (P = 0.001). Logistic regression showed muscle wasting to be independently associated with reduced peak VO2 adjusted for age, sex, New York Heart Association class, haemoglobin, LVEF, distance walked in 6 minutes, and the number of co-morbidities (odds ratio 6.53, p = 0.01).<br />CONCLUSION: Muscle wasting is a frequent co-morbidity among patients with chronic HF.

The medical records of these patients were retrospectively reviewed.<br />RESULTS: A total of 50 patients with Aeromonas peritonitis were identified. Nine cases were classified as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and 41 cases were classified as secondary peritonitis. The most common etiology of secondary peritonitis was acute appendicitis (n=26), followed by small bowel perforation (n=7) and colon perforation (n=6). The patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis were more likely to be immunocompromised (p=0.0013) and more frequently had an initial presentation of shock (p=0.0129), an abnormal liver function (p<0.05) and concomitant bacteremia (p=0.0024) than the patients with secondary peritonitis. Although the patients with secondary peritonitis had higher levels of inflammatory parameters, including leukocytes and C-reactive protein, and more frequent polymicrobial infections, their survival outcome rates, such as in-hospital mortality, were significantly lower (p=0.0007). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 20%, and initial shock was the only independent prognostic factor for mortality (p=0.012).<br />CONCLUSION: The clinical characteristics, including outcomes, of patients with spontaneous and secondary Aeromonas peritonitis differ. In-hospital mortality is significantly associated with the initial presentation of shock.","24240790","2013",\N

Two readers coded visualization of the appendix, measured the diameter of the appendix, and described the attenuation of its contents in relation to the intestinal wall. They also coded the presence of colonic wall redundancy, pancreatic fatty replacement, and cirrhosis. Lung transplant status and CFTR gene mutations were recorded. Analysis of variance, linear regression analysis, Student t test, and Pearson test were used.<br />RESULTS: The appendix was detected in all patients. The mean diameter was recorded as 10.6 Â± 3.5 mm. The mean diameter was larger when the appendix contained hyperattenuating material (p = 0.001). There was no association between diameter and the other coded CT findings (p = 0.076-0.466), transplant status (p = 0.788), or CFTR mutation (p = 0.078).

The aim of this study was to determine if, and to what extent, markers of BC and body fat (BF) distribution are related to cardiac autonomic control in NAFLD patients.<br />SUBJECTS/METHODS: BC was assessed with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 28 NAFLD patients (19 men, 51Â±13 years, and 9 women, 47Â±13 years). BF depots ratios were calculated to assess BF distribution. Subjects' HRR was recorded 1 (HRR1) and 2â€‰min (HRR2) immediately after a maximum graded exercise test.<br />RESULTS: BC and BF distribution were related to HRR; particularly weight, trunk BF and trunk BF-to-appendicular BF ratio showed a negative relation with HRR1 (r=-0.613, r=-0.597 and r=-0.547, respectively, P<0.01) and HRR2 (r=-0.484, r=-0.446, P<0.05, and r=-0.590, P<0.01, respectively). Age seems to be related to both HRR1 and HRR2 except when controlled for BF distribution. The preferred model in multiple regression should include trunk BF-to-appendicular BF ratio and BF to predict HRR1 (r2=0.549; P<0.05), and trunk BF-to-appendicular BF ratio alone to predict HRR2 (r2=0.430; P<0.001).<br />CONCLUSIONS: BC and BF distribution were related to HRR in NAFLD patients. Trunk BF-to-appendicular BF ratio was the best independent predictor of HRR and therefore may be best related to cardiovascular increased risk, and possibly act as a mediator in age-related cardiac autonomic control variation.","24300906","2014","2"

Both patients had mild symptoms and a normal colonoscopy preoperatively. The diagnosis was not suspected in one patient prior to surgery. The elevated CEA prompted additional diagnostic radiologic investigations including ultrasonography, and computed tomography scans.

The presence of an elevated CEA associated with the presence of this entity is a rare presentation.<br />CONCLUSION: Because the diagnosis is rarely suspected prior to surgery patients with an enlarged appendix with associated elevated CEA levels should have careful investigations to exclude malignancy.","23973902","2013",\N

Blood tests revealed high levels of inflammatory markers, and infectious enteritis was diagnosed. A stool culture obtained on admission revealed no growth of any significant pathogens. Conservative therapy was undertaken with fasting and fluid replacement. On day 2 of admission, the fever resolved, the frequency of defecation reduced, the right flank pain began to subside, and the white blood cell count started to decrease. On hospital day 4, the frequency of diarrhea decreased to approximately 5 times per day, and the right flank pain resolved. However, the patient developed epigastric pain and increased blood levels of the pancreatic enzymes. Abdominal computed tomography revealed mild pancreatic enlargement. Acute pancreatitis was diagnosed, and conservative therapy with fasting and fluid replacement was continued. A day later, the blood levels of the pancreatic enzymes peaked out. On hospital day 7, the patient passed stools with fresh blood, and Campylobacter jejuni/coli was detected by culture. Lower gastrointestinal endoscopy performed on hospital day 8 revealed diffuse aphthae extending from the terminal ileum to the entire colon. Based on the findings, pancreatitis associated with Campylobacter enteritis was diagnosed. In the present case, a possible mechanism of onset of pancreatitis was invasion of the pancreatic duct by Campylobacter and the host immune responses to Campylobacter.","24966623","2014","6"

The disease is named after Claudius Amyand, who performed the first documented and successful appendectomy during a hernioplasty in 1975. Finding an appendix within an inguinal hernia is reported at a rate of 0.51%-1% in the adult population, whereas there is no reported frequency of Amyand's hernia in children due to its rare occurrence. Here, we report two cases of Amyand's hernia. The first is a newborn, diagnosed with strangulated Amyand's hernia by preoperative ultrasound examination of the groin. In this case, the appendix had compromised blood supply, so we performed appendectomy during the hernioplasty. The second patient was diagnosed with Amyand's hernia during elective hernioplasty. In this case, the appendix had no evidence of circulatory or inflammatory disorders, so we performed simple hernioplasty and left the appendix in the abdominal cavity. In Amyand's hernia, there are no standards in approaching the appendix. Appendectomy is not a necessity unless there are circulatory or inflammatory injuries.","24214795","2013","9"
"1146","Presenting characteristics of patients undergoing cardiac troponin measurements in the emergency department.","CJEM","UNLABELLED: ABSTRACTIntroduction:Not all patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) receiving cardiac troponin (cTn) testing present to the emergency department (ED) with cardiac chest pain. Since elderly patients (age â‰¥ 70) have increased morbidity and mortality associated with ACS, complaints other than cardiac chest pain may justify cTn testing. Our primary objective was to characterize the population of ED patients who receive cTn testing. The secondary objective was to determine if elderly patients underwent cTn testing for different presenting complaints than their younger counterparts.<br />METHODS: We created an electronic database including Canadian Emergency Department Information Systems (CEDIS) presenting complaints, age, sex, disposition, and Canadian Triage Acuity Scale (CTAS) score, for patients who received cTn testing in three Canadian EDs during 2011. We analyzed the data for patient characteristics and sorted by age (< 70 and â‰¥ 70) for further analysis.<br />RESULTS: In the 15,824 included patients, the average age was 66 (51% < 70; 51% female). The most common presenting complaints were cardiac chest pain (n â€Š=â€Š 3,267) and shortness of breath (n â€Š=â€Š 2,266). The elderly underwent cTn testing for significantly (p < 0.0001) different complaints than their younger counterparts. They more commonly presented with generalized weakness (n â€Š=â€Š 898), whereas younger patients more frequently had abdominal pain (n â€Š=â€Š 576).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac chest pain and shortness of breath are presenting complaints in one-third of patients undergoing ED cTn testing. The majority of patients undergoing cTn testing did not have typical ACS symptoms. Half of all cTn testing in the ED is on the elderly, who present with different complaints than their younger counterparts.","24456860","2014","2"

In this report, we present a case of a 12-year-old girl with colon adenocarcinoma, treated with surgery and XELOX chemotherapy.<br />METHODS: On admission, the girl complained of abdominal pain and intestinal obstruction. Physical examination revealed a distended abdomen with tenderness on the left upper quadrant. Barium enema revealed a stenotic lesion at the distal end of the transverse colon, and abdominal computed tomography showed acute obstruction and a colonic mass. Laparotomy was performed after the failure of conservative treatment.<br />RESULTS: The mass was originated from the transverse colon. Frozen sections of the specimens revealed an adenocarcinoma. Transverse colectomy was performed and regional lymph nodes were removed. Pathological examination confirmed that the mass was a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, and XELOX chemotherapy was used. No evidence of recurrent or metastatic tumor was found after 18 months.<br />CONCLUSION: Although complete resection is the most effective treatment, XELOX chemotherapy is beneficial to the improvement of clinical outcome of patients with colon adenocarcinoma.","24464671","2014","2"

Despite recent improvements, systemic chemotherapy has limited efficacy. We report the first application of intraperitoneal chemotherapy as a pressurized aerosol in human patients.<br />METHODS: Three end-stage patients with advanced PC from gastric, appendiceal, and ovarian origin were treated as a compassionate therapy. All patients had received previous systemic chemotherapy. A pressurized aerosol of CO2 loaded with doxorubicin 1.5 mg/m(2) and cisplatin 7.5 mg/m(2) (pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy, PIPAC) was applied into the abdomen for 30 min at a pressure of 12 mmHg and a temperature of 37 Â°C.<br />RESULTS: No side-effects >2 CTCAE were observed, and the procedures were well tolerated. Early hospital discharge was possible (days 2-5). Nuclear presence of doxorubicin was documented throughout the peritoneum, reaching high local concentration (â‰¤4.1 Î¼mol/g) and plasma concentration was low (4.0-6.2 ng/ml). PIPAC created no significant adhesions, could be repeated, and was applied 6Ã—, 4Ã—, and 2Ã—. Two patients showed a complete and one a partial histological remission. Mean survival after the first PIPAC was 288 days. One patient is alive after 567 days.<br />CONCLUSIONS: PIPAC shows superior pharmacological properties with high local concentration and low systemic exposure. PIPAC can induce regression of PC in chemoresistant tumors, using 10% of a usual systemic dose.","24006094","2014","2"

Pregnant women suffer from rheumatic diseases of the heart valves, hypertension, congenital heart deffects, inflammatory and ischemic disorders or pathologies of the electrical conduction system of the heart. Myocarditis during pregnancy occurs very seldom. Few cases of severe myocarditis during gestation have been reported in the literature. This report presents a case of a 27-year-old Asian patient, at 8 weeks of gestation, diagnosed with an acute myocarditis. The woman was admitted to the hospital, presenting with early and nonspecific symptoms, (fever up of 38.5 degrees Celsiuss, abdominal pain and nausea). After temporary improvement, the patient's condition deteriorated. On the fourth day of the hospitalization, myocarditis led to heart failure and the patient had to be transffered to the Intensive Care Unit. Wide-spectrum antibiotics, glucocorticoids, diuretics, bisoprolol, as well as fluid and electrolyte supplementation, were administered. After 22 days of treatment the patient was discharged home in good condition. Afterwards she attended follow-up visits at the Gynecology-Obstetric Outpatient Clinic.

"1152","Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) of the pancreas: case series and literature review on an enigmatic entity.","International journal of clinical and experimental pathology","Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) of the pancreas is a rare tumor which typically affects young women without significant clinical symptoms. SPN usually shows an indolent behavior and only rare cases recur and/or metastasize after complete resection. We report our experience with four cases of SPN of the pancreas. All four patients were female with an age range of 15-42 years (mean age: 24.5 years). Two patients presented with abdominal pain, one with abdominal mass and one with acute abdominal signs following blunt trauma. Tumor's size ranged from 1 to 16 cm (mean size: 5.5 cm). Two tumors were diagnosed preoperatively through percutaneous core needle biopsy and two underwent surgery without preoperative diagnosis because of high suspicion of SPN based on clinical and radiological findings. By immunohistochemistry, all cases stained strongly for vimentin, progesterone-receptor and beta-catenin (nuclear) and variably with pankeratin and neuroendocrine markers. The proliferation index (Ki-67) was <2% in all cases. After a median follow-up of 40 months (range: 24-57 months), all patients were alive with no evidence of recurrence or metastatic disease. In conclusion, SPN of the pancreas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any solid and partly cystic pancreatic or upper abdominal mass, particularly in young females. SPN possesses a low malignant potential and complete surgical resection with clear margins is the treatment of choice. Following R0 resection, SPN has an excellent prognosis.","23696922","2013",\N
"1153","Treatment of acute abdominal pain in the emergency room: a systematic review of the literature.","European journal of pain (London, England)","Appropriate pain therapy prior to diagnosis in patients with acute abdominal pain remains controversial. Several recent studies have demonstrated that pain therapy does not negatively influence either the diagnosis or subsequent treatment of these patients; however, current practice patterns continue to favour withholding pain medication prior to diagnosis and surgical treatment decision. A systematic review of PubMed, Web-of-Science and The-Cochrane-Library from 1929 to 2011 was carried out using the key words of 'acute', 'abdomen', 'pain', 'emergency' as well as different pain drugs in use, revealed 84 papers. The results of the literature review were incorporated into six sections to describe management of acute abdominal pain: (1) Physiology of Pain; (2) Common Aetiologies of Abdominal Pain; (3) Pre-diagnostic Analgesia; (4) Pain Therapy for Acute Abdominal Pain; (5) Analgesia for Acute Abdominal Pain in Special Patient Populations; and (6) Ethical and Medico-legal Considerations in Current Analgesia Practices. A comprehensive algorithm for analgesia for acute abdominal pain in the general adult population was developed. A review of the literature of common aetiologies and management of acute abdominal pain in the general adult population and special patient populations seen in the emergency room revealed that intravenous administration of paracetamol, dipyrone or piritramide are currently the analgesics of choice in this clinical setting. Combinations of non-opioids and opioids should be administered in patients with moderate, severe or extreme pain, adjusting the treatment on the basis of repeated pain assessment, which improves overall pain management.","24449533","2014","8"

We evaluated the association between intake of dairy foods and peripheral bone structure and muscle mass in 564 elderly women aged 80 to 92 (mean 84.7) years, who were participants of the Calcium Intake Fracture Outcome Study/CAIFOS Aged Extension Study (CAIFOS/CARES) cohort and attended the 10-year follow-up. Assessments included dairy consumption (milk, yogurt, and cheese) by a validated food frequency questionnaire, 15% tibia bone mass, area and volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), and appendicular bone and skeletal muscle mass by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Women were categorized according to tertiles of dairy intake: first tertile (â‰¤ 1.5 servings/d), second tertile (1.5 to 2.2 servings/d) and third tertile (â‰¥ 2.2 servings/d). Controlling for confounding factors, pQCT assessment at the 15% tibia showed that compared with those in the first tertile of dairy intake, women in the third tertile had 5.7% greater total bone mass (p = 0.005), principally because of an increase in cortical and subcortical bone mass (5.9%, p = 0.050), resulting in a 6.2% increase in total vBMD (p = 0.013). Trabecular but not cortical and subcortical vBMD was also higher (7.8%, p = 0.044). DXA assessment showed that women in the third tertile of dairy intake had greater appendicular bone mass (7.1%, p = 0.007) and skeletal muscle mass (3.3%, p = 0.014) compared with tertile 1. The associations with bone measures were dependent on dairy protein and calcium intakes, whereas the association with appendicular muscle mass was not totally dependent on dairy protein intake. Our results suggest a positive association of dairy intake with appendicular bone mineralization and muscle mass in elderly women. Because many fractures in this age group are of the appendicular skeleton often associated with falls, dairy intake may be a modifiable lifestyle factor contributing to healthy aging.","24443390","2014","7"

We measured appendicular muscle mass (AMM) by bioelectrical impedance analysis, grip strength, and usual walking speed. A low muscle mass was defined by the AMM index (AMI, weight [kg]/height [m(2)] as >2 standard deviations below the mean AMI for normal young subjects. The lowest quartile for grip strength and usual walking speed were classified as low muscle strength and low physical performance, respectively. \"Sarcopenia\" was characterized by a low muscle mass, combined with either a low muscle strength or low physical performance. Subjects without low muscle mass or strength and low physical performance were classified as \"normal.\" Subjects were classified as being \"intermediate\" if they were neither \"sarcopenic\" nor \"normal.\" Items in the questionnaire included residential status, past medical history, admission during the past year, smoking and drinking habits, leisure-time physical activity, health status, depression, masticatory ability, and dietary variety score.<br />RESULTS: Sarcopenia was identified in 13.7% of men and 15.5% of women. Among men, a large proportion of subjects with sarcopenia had poor masticatory ability and a low dietary variety score compared with normal or intermediate subjects. Among women, a large proportion of the subjects with sarcopenia lived alone, had poor exercise habits, considered themselves to be unhealthy, and had poor masticatory ability compared with normal or intermediate subjects. A multiple logistic regression analysis showed that age and dietary variety in men and age and masticatory ability in women were associated with sarcopenia.<br />CONCLUSION: The present study carried out in Japan showed that sarcopenia, assessed by muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance, was associated with age, dietary variety score (in men), and masticatory ability (in women).","24418916","2013",\N

The nondiscriminating effects of this mechanism often result in both appendicular and axial skeletal injuries. Despite this recognized coincident injury pattern, the incidence and consequence of spine fractures in trauma-related combat amputees are unknown.<br />PURPOSE: This study sought to determine the incidence and morbidity of the associated spine fractures on patients with traumatic lower extremity amputation sustained during OIF/OEF.<br />STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Retrospective case control.<br />PATIENT SAMPLE: Two hundred twenty-six combat-related lower extremity amputees presenting to a single institution and injured between 2003 and 2008 were included for analysis.<br />OUTCOME MEASURES: Physiologic and functional outcome measures were used to determine the influence of spine fractures on combat amputees. Physiologic measures included intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates, injury severity score (ISS), rate of narcotic/neuropathic pain use, and heterotopic ossification (HO) rates. Functional outcome measures included return-to-duty rates and ambulatory status at final follow-up.<br />METHODS: Data from 300 consecutive combat-related lower extremity amputations were retrospectively reviewed and grouped. Group 1 consisted of amputees with associated spine fractures, and Group 2 consisted of amputees without spine fractures. The results of the two groups were compared with regard to initial presentation and final functional outcomes.<br />RESULTS: A total of 226 patients sustained 300 lower extremity amputations secondary to combat-related injuries, the most common mechanism being an improvised explosive device. Twenty-nine of these patients had a spine fracture (13%). Group 1 had a higher ISS than Group 2 (30 vs. 19, p<.001). Group 1 patients were also more likely to be admitted to the ICU (86% vs. 46%, p<.001). Furthermore, Group 1 patients had a significantly higher rate of HO in their residual limbs (82% vs. 55%, p<.005).<br />CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of spine fractures in combat-related amputees is 13%. The results suggest that combat-related amputees with spine fractures are more likely to sustain severe injuries to other body systems, as indicated by the significantly higher ISS and rates of ICU admission. This group also had a significantly higher rate of HO formation, which may be attributable to the greater local and/or systemic injuries sustained by these patients.","24071037","2014","4"

The primary end point was early postoperative pain (measured by opiate usage and pain score in the first 12 hours). Secondary end points were operative time, complication rate (including conversions), and recovery time (days of oral opiate usage and return to work). After 6 months, body image and cosmetic appearance were assessed using a validated survey.<br />RESULTS: The trial was planned for 150 patients, but was halted after 75 patients when planned interim analysis showed that SILS patients had more postoperative pain (pain score: 4.4 Â± 1.6 vs 3.5 Â± 1.5; p = 0.01) and higher inpatient opiate usage (hydromorphone use: 3.9 Â± 1.9 mg vs 2.8 Â± 1.7 mg; p = 0.01) than 3-port laparoscopy. Operative time for SILS averaged 40% longer (54 Â± 17 minutes vs 38 Â± 11 minutes; p < 0.01). Only 1 SILS case was converted to 3-port. There were no significant differences in length of stay, complications, oral pain medication usage after discharge, or return to work. After 6 months, body image and cosmetic appearance were excellent for both groups and indistinguishable by most measures. However, 3-port patients reported better physical attractiveness (4.0 Â± 0.4 vs 3.8 Â± 0.4; p = 0.04) and SILS patients reported better scars (score 18.4 Â± 2.7 vs 16.4 Â± 3.0; p < 0.01).

"1162","","Who Will Keep the Public Healthy? Workshop Summary","In today's world the public faces many health threats from bioterrorism to the epidemic of obesity. It's thus important to have an effective public health system. This system depends significantly on the quality and preparedness of our public health workforce as well as the quality of public health education and training. In March, 2001 the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation asked the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to examine the education of public health professionals and develop recommendations for how public health education, training, and research could be strengthened to meet the needs of future public health professionals to improve population-level health. As a result the Committee on Educating Public Health Professionals for the 21st Century was formed; members can be seen in Appendix A. Over the course of one year, the committee held five meetings; reviewed and analyzed key literature; and abstracted, analyzed, and synthesized data from catalogs, web sites, and survey responses of accredited schools of public health. Because numerous institutions and agencies play important roles in public health education, training, research, and leadership development, the report addresses its recommendations to schools of public health, degree-granting programs in public health, medical schools, schools of nursing, other professional schools (e.g., law), and local, state, and federal public health agencies. Conclusions and recommendations for each of these sectors are present in the report. The report generated a lot of discussion, resulting in the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation asking the IOM to hold a workshop of interested people to foster joint discussion among the academic and practice communities.

As struma ovarii is an uncommon entity, it is all the more important to perform state-of-the-art magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including high-resolution imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging. The goal of this review paper is to give an update of the key findings of both benign and malignant struma ovarii and to present an unusual case of a purely cystic ovarian struma. Key Points â€¢ Clinical features in struma ovarii are generally non-specific and resemble ovarian malignancy.â€¢ Pre-operative radiological diagnosis is important to avoid ovarian cancer type surgery (bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, hysterectomy, omentectomy and occasionally appendectomy).â€¢ State-of-the-art MR imaging might help to characterise this unusual ovarian mass.â€¢ Struma ovarii can occasionally present as a purely cystic lesion.â€¢ However, the role of imaging to identify struma ovarii preoperatively remains limited.","24357453","2014","2"

Among 43% (102) of the patients with a positive result, Escherichia coli was isolated in 76.5% (78), Proteus mirabilis in 13.7% (14), Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 4.9% (5) and Citrobacter freundii in 4.9% (5). Five cases had bacteria resistant to the antibiotic given preoperatively (that is 4.9% of all positive cultures and 1.4% of all operated patients). However, these cases did not affect the incidence of postoperative complications. Consideration of the postoperative morbidity showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the laparoscopic group with and without intra-operative swabbing (p > 0.05).<br />CONCLUSIONS: The postoperative patient outcome was more dependent on the pathology of the appendix than on the results of the microbiological assessment at the time of surgery. Hence, routine intra-operative cultures during laparoscopic appendectomies appear to have little value in patient management. Swabbing during laparoscopic procedures should be limited to only selected high-risk groups.","24501600","2013","12"

In this study, we present the clinical details, the management strategies, and the outcome of fourteen patients of EPN managed at our center.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the hospital records was done. A total of fourteen patients with EPN were admitted in our hospital from August 2007 to February 2011. All the patients were managed conservatively. Follow-up ranged from six months to one year.<br />RESULTS: Of the fourteen patients, four belonged to class I, five to class II, four to class IIIA and one to class IIIB. All the patients had history of fever, 43% had localized flank pain while 36% had vague abdominal discomfort. Renal angle tenderness was the most common sign, seen in 86% of the patients. E. coli was the most common bacteria, which was isolated from urine in 57% of the patients. On the risk factor stratification, three patients had simultaneous presence of 2 or more risk factors (thrombocytopenia-2 patients; renal function impairment-7 patients; shock-1 patient). All the patients were initially managed with aggressive fluid and electrolyte resuscitation, control of blood sugar levels, and broad spectrum antibiotics. Intervention, in the form of percutaneous drainage or DJ stenting, was done in six patients. One patient failed to respond to this minimally invasive modality of treatment and had to undergo an open drainage. Thus, the acute episode was managed with conservative management strategies in all the patients; however, three patients underwent nephrectomy due to poorly-functioning kidney during follow-up.<br />CONCLUSIONS: EPN is now being more readily diagnosed, at an early stage, making conservative management of EPN a safe, effective, and feasible option.","24049377","2013","7"

De Garengeot first described a femoral hernia containing the appendix in 1731. Appendicitis occurring in this rare clinical setting represents a challenge in diagnosis and management. Case Presentation. We present the case of a 71-year-old male with a three-day history of a nontender inguinal mass. Computed tomography (CT) suggested a femoral hernia. Intraoperatively, the hernia sac was noted to contain a perforated appendix. Discussion. This is an infrequently reported clinical scenario and only the 14th reported case in peer-reviewed literature which includes preoperative CT images. Our case adds to previously reported low sensitivity of CT for diagnosing De Garengeot's hernia. Furthermore, unlike our case the vast majority of previous reports noted a painful inguinal swelling. Conclusion. Perforated appendicitis in a femoral hernia is an extremely uncommon presentation. However, consideration should be given to De Garengeot's hernia in patients with a groin mass, even if nontender.","24716081","2014",\N

Despite aggressive treatment, including the use of steroid pulse therapy and continuous hemodiafiltration, the patient died. Although polyarteritis nodosa is extremely rare in patients with acute abdomen, acute abdomen is relatively common manifestation of that. And it is reported that involvement of small intestine suggests poorer prognosis. Our case highlights the importance of vasculitis as a differential diagnosis of patients with atypical acute abdomen.

We report a case of acute hepatitis associated with chronic use of high doses of Tinospora crispa. A 49-year-old male with chronic low back pain bought a herbal medicine at a market in Vietnam that was supposed to be Tinospora crispa, and started to take 10 pellets per day. He had no medical history and did not take any other drugs or toxins. Four weeks later; he developed dark urine and pale stools, associated with asthenia and right hypochondrial pain. Two months after starting treatment, he was referred to the hepatology department with jaundice. Blood tests showed aspartate aminotransferase: 1.169 IU/l, alanine aminotransferase: 2.029 IU/l, total bilirubin: 20.47 mg/dl, direct bilirubin: 13.29 mg/dl, and Î³-glutamyltransferase: 243 IU/l. Viral and autoimmune hepatitis were eliminated. Upper abdominal ultrasound was normal. Histopathological findings were consistent with a toxic reaction. The herbal medicine was stopped on admission and the patient fully recovered without treatment, with normal liver function 2 months after the acute episode. Tinospora crispa was clearly identified in the pellets by microscopic analysis of the botanical characters combined with chromatographic fingerprints. The use of herbal medicines containing Tinospora crispa can induce toxic hepatitis. Recovery can be complete after discontinuation.

"1176","An evaluation of the morphologic features of low-grade mucinous neoplasms of the appendix metastatic in the ovary, and comparison with primary ovarian mucinous tumors.","International journal of gynecological pathology : official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Pathologists","It may be difficult to distinguish ovarian involvement by a low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (LAMN) from a primary gastrointestinal-type primary borderline (proliferative) ovarian tumor (IBMT) or an ovarian mucinous tumor arising within a teratoma, particularly when the latter is associated with mucinous ascites/pseudomyxoma peritonei. We noted that LAMNs involving the ovaries show 2 distinctive histologic features, \"scalloped\" glands and subepthelial stromal clefts, whereas IBMTs more often are associated with reactive cellular stroma and histiocyte aggregates (mucin granulomas). The frequency of these features was investigated in 18 LAMNs (16 with pseudomyxoma peritonei), 18 primary IBMTs, and 6 teratoma-associated mucinous tumors (selected on the basis of associated pseudomyxoma peritonei). Scalloped glands and subepithelial clefts were identified in 17 and 16 LAMNs, respectively, and in 3 and 7 IBMTs, respectively. Conversely, reactive stroma and histiocyte aggregates were present in 2 and 0 LAMNs, respectively, and in 11 and 10 IBMTs, respectively. LAMNs were often bilateral (12/18 cases) and they more frequently showed mucin dissection of the ovarian stroma and tall mucin-rich (hypermucinous) epithelial cells compared with IBMTs. Our findings suggest that scalloped glands, subepithelial clefts, cellular stroma, and histiocyte aggregates may be useful additional morphologic parameters to help distinguish these tumor types. However, teratoma-associated mucinous neoplasms can show identical histologic features to those of LAMNs involving the ovary, and therefore accurate diagnosis of such cases requires careful macroscopic and microscopic examinations of the ovaries together with complete histologic assessment of the appendix.","24300528","2014","1"

To assess the effect of increased ERRÎ³ activity on cartilage development in vivo, we generated two transgenic (Tg) lines overexpressing ERRÎ³2 via a chondrocyte-specific promoter; the two lines exhibited âˆ¼3 and âˆ¼5 fold increased ERRÎ³2 protein expression respectively in E14.5 Tg versus wild type (WT) limbs. On postnatal day seven (P7), we observed a 4-10% reduction in the size of the craniofacial, axial and appendicular skeletons in Tg versus WT mice. The reduction in bone length was already present at birth and did not appear to involve bones that are derived via intramembranous bone formation as the bones of the calvaria, clavicle, and the mandible developed normally. Histological analysis of P7 growth plates revealed a reduction in the length of the Tg versus WT growth plate, the majority of which was attributable to a reduced proliferative zone. The reduced proliferative zone paralleled a decrease in the number of Ki67-positive proliferating cells, with no significant change in apoptosis, and was accompanied by large cell-free swaths of cartilage matrix, which extended through multiple zones of the growth plate. Using a bioinformatics approach, we identified known chondrogenesis-associated genes with at least one predicted ERR binding site in their proximal promoters, as well as cell cycle regulators known to be regulated by ERRÎ³. Of the genes identified, Col2al, Agg, Pth1r, and Cdkn1b (p27) were significantly upregulated, suggesting that ERRÎ³2 negatively regulates chondrocyte proliferation and positively regulates matrix synthesis to coordinate growth plate height and organization.","24349082","2013",\N

A 14-year-old female patient suffering from cryptogenic cirrhosis had undergone liver transplantation. The liver was received from a deceased donor. She presented to our clinic with complaints of abdominal pain, diarrhea, flushing, fatigue, and syncope four years after transplantation. On multislice computed tomography, multiple masses ranging from 1 cm to 4 cm in size were detected in both lobes of the transplanted liver. Biopsy from both lobes revealed carcinoid tumor. The primary tumor could not be localized, and a colonoscopy was scheduled. As the patient refused an invasive investigation, octreotide therapy was begun. Her symptoms related to the carcinoid tumor diminished following initiation of the octreotide therapy. During the fifth year of octreotide therapy, a whole-body positron emission tomography (PET CT) with 10 mCi F-18 fludeoxyglucose (FDG) showed an increase in the metabolic activity with a SUVmax value of 8 at the localization site, consistent with the ileocecal region. The findings were considered secondary, as the carcinoid tumor originated from the appendix or distal ileum. Again, the patient again refused endoscopic investigations and continued the follow-up visits. To our knowledge, this is the only reported case in the scientific literature of a carcinoid tumor that metastasized to a transplanted liver.","24918143","2014","2"

Transgastric natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery for periotoneoscopy, cholecystectomy, and appendectomy all seem viable in humans, but additional studies are required to demonstrate their benefits and roles in clinical practice. The submucosal tunneling method enhances the safety of peritoneal access and gastric closure and minimizes the risk of intraperitoneal leakage of gastric air and juice. Submucosal tunneling involves submucosal tumor resection and peroral endoscopic myotomy. Peroral endoscopic myotomy is a safe and effective treatment option for achalasia, and the most promising natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery procedure.

Clinical outcomes were evaluated by medical records, operative notes and mailed questionnaires. Patient satisfaction scores (SSs) were measured on a modified visual analog scale (VAS) from 1 to 10, and the factors influencing the SS were analyzed.<br />RESULTS: A 100% return rate for the mailed questionnaires was achieved. All patients underwent in situ appendicocecostomy with cecal plication. There was only one complication that required surgical revision. Regarding fecal continence, the overall success rate was 90%. Although 4 patients (19%) had severe irrigation pain and 4 patients (19%) found the washout time intolerably long, 18 (85%) of them were satisfied with the MACE procedure.

In our analysis, younger age at operation, previous experience of RCE, no stomal leakage and improvement of quality of life (enhanced comfort at school, workplace and sleepovers) significantly influenced the high satisfaction after MACE.","24081017","2014","1"
"1183","A Proposal to Unify the Classification of Breast and Prostate Cancers Based on the Anatomic Site of Cancer Origin and on Long-term Patient Outcome.","Breast cancer : basic and clinical research","The similarity between the structure and function of the breast and prostate has been known for a long time, but there are serious discrepancies in the terminology describing breast and prostate cancers. The use of the large, thick-section (3D) histology technique for both organs exposes the irrationality of the breast cancer terminology. Pathologists with expertise in diagnosing prostate cancer take the anatomic site of cancer origin into account when using the terms AAP (acinar adenocarcinoma of the prostate) and DAP (ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate) to distinguish between the prostate cancers originating primarily from the fluid-producing acinar portion of the organ (AAP) and the tumors originating either purely from the larger ducts (DAP) or from both the acini and the main ducts combined (DAP and AAP). Long-term patient outcome is closely correlated with the terminology, because patients with DAP have a significantly poorer prognosis than patients with AAP. The current breast cancer terminology could be improved by modeling it after the method of classifying prostate cancer to reflect the anatomic site of breast cancer origin and the patient outcome. The long-term survival curves of our consecutive breast cancer cases collected since 1977 clearly show that the non-palpable, screen-detected breast cancers originating from the milk-producing acini have excellent prognosis, irrespective of their histologic malignancy grade or biomarkers. Correspondingly, the breast cancer subtypes of truly ductal origin have a significantly poorer outcome, despite recent improvements in diagnosis and therapy. The mammographic appearance of breast cancers reflects the underlying tissue structure. Addition of these \"mammographic tumor features\" to the currently used histologic phenotypes makes it possible to distinguish the breast cancer cases of ductal origin with a poor outcome, termed DAB (ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast), from the more easily managed breast cancers of acinar origin, termed AAB (acinar adenocarcinoma of the breast), which have a significantly better outcome. This simple and easily communicable terminology could lead to better communication between the diagnostic and therapeutic team members and result in more rational treatment planning for the benefit of their patients.","24653647","2014",\N

All patients received ACE inhibitors and immune inhibitors. Control examinations carried out in 3-month intervals included history, assessment of clinical symptoms, physical examination, US of the abdomen and laboratory blood analysis. In addition, if clinical symptoms were newly encountered, children were admitted between regularly scheduled intervals. We analyzed results of abdominal US for pathological findings of the bowel, and we assessed imaging findings in children diagnosed with acquired angioedema.<br />RESULTS: Acquired angioedema was diagnosed in 3/207 patients (2 girls ages 16 and 17Â years and 1 boy age 9Â months). These children presented with sudden onset of severe abdominal pain. The bowel wall was thickened in the presence of ascites. After a mean of 72Â h, abdominal pains resolved.

There is a growing concern that the pendulum has now shifted too far toward MIS and that current general surgery residents' exposure to open abdominal procedures is lacking.<br />OBJECTIVE: We sought to analyze trends in open vs MIS intra-abdominal procedures performed by residents graduating from US general surgery residency programs over the past twelve years.<br />METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the data from the ACGME national resident case log reports for graduating US general surgery residents from 2000 to 2011. We analyzed the average number of cases per graduating chief resident for the following surgical procedures: appendectomy, inguinal/femoral hernia repair, gastrostomy, colectomy, antireflux procedures, and cholecystectomy.<br />RESULTS: For all the procedures analyzed, except antireflux procedures, a statistically significant increase in the number of MIS cases was seen. The increases in MIS procedures were as follows: appendectomy, 8.5 to 46 (542%); inguinal/femoral hernia repair, 7.6 to 23.3 (265%); gastrostomy, 1.4 to 3 (114%); colectomy, 1.8 to 18.2 (1011%); and cholecystectomy, 84 to 105.7 (26%). The p value was set at <0.001 for all procedures. There has been a concomitant decrease in the number of open procedures. The numbers of open appendectomy decreased from 30.9 to 15.5 (p < 0.0001), open inguinal/femoral hernia repair from 52.1 to 48 (p = 0.0038), open gastrostomy from 7.7 to 4.9 (p = 0.0094), open colectomy from 48 to 40.7 (p < 0.0001), open cholecystectomy from 15.5 to 10.4 (p = 0.0005), and open antireflux procedures from 4.7 to 1.7 (p < 0.001). An analysis conducted over time reveals that the rates of increase in MIS procedures in 5 of the 6 categories continue to rise, whereas the rates of open appendectomy, open colectomy, and open antireflux procedures continue to decrease. However, the rates of decline of open hernia repairs and open gastrostomies seem to have plateaued.<br />CONCLUSIONS: The performance of open procedures in general surgery residency has declined significantly in the past 12 years. The effect of the decline in open cases in surgical training and practice remains to be determined.","24209640",\N,\N

However, increasing numbers of patients with CDAD are being admitted to acute-care hospitals from long-term care facilities (LTCFs) and the local community. The purpose of our study was to study the changing epidemiological trends of CDAD patients admitted to an acute-care hospital and examine factors contributing to this shift in epidemiology.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: This IRB-approved retrospective study included 400 randomly selected patients with a diagnosis of CDAD, admitted to an acute-care hospital between January, 2005 and December, 2010. CDAD was defined as â‰¥3 episodes of loose stools in <24 h with a positive Clostridium difficile stool toxin assay. The patients were divided into three groups: hospital-acquired CDAD, long-term care facility (LTCF)-acquired CDAD, and community-acquired CDAD. The groups were compared in terms of demographics, ICU admissions, hospital length of stay, co-morbidities, presenting complaint, and medication use. Patients who were hospitalized in the preceding 12 weeks or who had history of antibiotic use in the prior 8 weeks were excluded.<br />RESULTS: Final analysis included 258 toxin-positive CDAD patients. Only 53 (20.6%) patients had hospital-acquired CDAD. Patients from LTCFs (n=119, 46.1%) and the community (86 patients, 33.3%) comprised 79.4% of patients. The mean age for LTCF population was significantly higher than the hospital-acquired and community-acquired CDAD groups (p<0.0001). The presenting complaint was categorized as diarrhea or non-diarrheal symptom. Other non-diarrheal symptoms included fever, abdominal pain and altered mental status. Only 15.2% of LTCF patients had diarrhea as their presenting complaint (n=18) as compared to 29.1% of patients from the community (n=25; p<0.05). Most LTCF patients (n=101, 84.8%) had non-diarrheal symptoms as their presenting complaint as compared to only 61 patients from the community (70.9%) (p<0.05). Use of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) was more frequent in LTCF patients (73%) and patients with hospital-acquired CDAD (69.8%) as compared to patients with community-acquired CDAD (43%) (p<0.05). No valid indication was found for PPI use in 24.13% of LTCF patients and 32.1% of patients with community-acquired CDAD as compared to only 12.9% of patients with hospital-acquired CDAD.<br />CONCLUSION: These observations suggest that CDAD originated predominantly in patients from LTCFs (46.1%) and community (33.3%) rather than from hospitalized patients (20.6%). Diarrhea was the presenting complaint in LTCF patients in only 15.2% of cases. Hence, CDAD should be suspected if LTCF patients present with symptoms such as abdominal pain, fever, or altered mental status along with loose stools. Majority of the LTCF patients were found to be on PPIs, a risk factor for CDAD, with as many as 24% of these patients with no valid indication for their use.","24154638","2013","12"

Examinations included: 1) probing depth, 2) clinical attachment level, and 3) oral radiographs for alveolar crestal height in a study ancillary to the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study (WHI-OS) conducted in Buffalo, New York, called the OsteoPerio study. Participants also self-reported any history of diagnosis of periodontal/gum disease on a WHI-OS study-wide questionnaire administered during the time interval between the two OsteoPerio examinations.<br />RESULTS: Participants reporting diagnosis of periodontal/gum disease on the WHI-OS questionnaire (n = 259; 26.6%) had worse oral hygiene habits, periodontal disease risk factors, and clinical periodontal measures compared with those not reporting periodontal/gum disease. Frequency of reported periodontal/gum disease was 13.5%, 24.7%, and 56.2% across OsteoPerio baseline examination categories of none/mild, moderate, and severe periodontal disease, respectively (trend: P <0.001), defined by criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/American Academy of Periodontology (CDC/AAP). Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for reported periodontal disease status were 56.2%, 78.8%, 32.8%, and 90.7%, respectively, when CDC/AAP-defined severe periodontal disease at baseline was the criterion measure (prevalence of 15%) and were 76.0%, 77.4%, 22.0%, and 97.4%, respectively, when tooth loss to periodontitis (prevalence of 7%) was the criterion.<br />CONCLUSION: A simple question for self-reported periodontal disease characterizes periodontal disease prevalence with moderate accuracy in postmenopausal females who regularly visit their dentist, particularly in those with more severe disease.","24354649","2014","8"

"1194","Does a new surgical residency program increase operating room times?","Journal of surgical education","BACKGROUND: Our country faces a shortage of surgeons; hence, we may anticipate the development of new surgery residencies. Therefore, the question of the effect of a new program on operating room times (ORT) is important. Our primary aim was to compare ORT of 3 common procedures done by attendings alone vs ORT of cases with residents.<br />METHODS: We queried records of 1458 patients from the JFK Medical Center database for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, open inguinal hernia repair, and laparoscopic appendectomy from July 2010 to July 2012. We divided the sample into 2 groups: \"attending alone\" (2010-2011) and \"with residents\" (2011-2012). The ORT was calculated by \"Cut time\" and \"Close time,\" as recorded in the OR. ORT for both groups was calculated using the unpaired t test.<br />RESULTS: Of the total number of patients, 778 underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 407 underwent open inguinal hernia repair, and 273 underwent laparoscopic appendectomy; of these, 620, 315, and 211 procedures, respectively, were done by the attending alone and 158, 92, and 62, respectively, were done with residents. Differences in ORT for the 3 types of surgery were statistically significant (p < 0.001). There was no statistical significance when comparing the first half with the second half of the academic year for residents' ORT.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Resident involvement increases ORT. Cost analysis considering OR time and anesthesia time vs federal funding for Graduate Medical Education is complicated. The benefit of new programs in diminishing the shortage of surgeons cannot be underestimated.","24209643",\N,\N
"1195","Early endovascular treatment of superior mesenteric occlusion secondary to thromboemboli.","European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate our early experience with endovascular revascularization in patients with acute thromboembolic occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA).<br />METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of all patients who underwent endovascular revascularization for acute thromboembolic SMA occlusion from May 2005 to May 2012. Endovascular revascularization was performed using aspiration, intra-arterial thrombolysis, and adjunctive stent-placement techniques. Laparotomy was performed if the patient developed clinical signs of advanced bowel ischemia after endovascular procedure.<br />RESULTS: Twenty-one patients underwent endovascular revascularization for acute thromboembolic SMA occlusion. All presented with acute-onset abdominal pain. Three patients had rebound tenderness before the procedure. Computed tomography angiography revealed complete occlusion in seven cases and incomplete occlusion in 14 cases, with no evidence of free gas or bowel necrosis. The median duration from onset of symptoms to revascularization was 8.7 Â± 4.1 hours (range, 2-18 hours). Completely successful endovascular revascularization occurred in six cases (aspiration alone, 3 cases; combined aspiration and urokinase, 3 cases); partial success was achieved in 15 cases (aspiration alone, 4 cases; combined aspiration and urokinase, 10 cases; and combined aspiration, urokinase, and stent placement, 1 case). Laparotomy was required in five patients, all of whom had SMA main trunk complete occlusion and required small bowel resection. The 30-day mortality for all patients was 9.5%. During a median follow-up of 26 months, 15 patients remained asymptomatic, three patients reported occasional abdominal pain, and one patient had temporary short-bowel syndrome.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous revascularization is a promising alternative to surgery for acute SMA occlusion in selected patients who have no signs of advanced bowel ischemia. Early diagnosis followed by prompt endovascular intervention with close postprocedural monitoring is key. Laparotomy is indicated in patients who develop new or worsening signs of peritonism after endovascular procedure, particularly in those who had complete occlusion of the main trunk of the SMA.","24183620","2014","2"

Clinical and laboratory findings were consistent with ISCLS. She received aggressive fluid replacement, methylprednisolone pulse (30 mg/kg/day), high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG, 2 g/kg/day) and plasma exchange in acute phase. She received fasciotomy of bilateral lower extremities as she developed complications of compartment syndrome. Since there were two episodes of ISCLS attacks, theophylline and terbutaline were initiated for prevention of attacks and then the remission is currently maintained. Because of high fatality rate in ISCLS, prompt diagnosis and intervention are very important.<br />CONCLUSION: We describe here, a rare case of pediatric ISCLS.

It is being diagnosed more frequently with the advent of modern cross-sectional imaging. Our review of the English literature disclosed 13 cases of thrombosed EPVA.<br />CASE PRESENTATION: A 50-years-old woman presented with acute abdominal pain but no other symptom. She had no relevant medical history. Palpation of the right upper quadrant showed tenderness. Laboratory tests were unremarkable. A computed tomography showed portal vein aneurysm measuring 88 Ã— 65 mm with thrombosis extending to the superior mesenteric and splenic vein. The patient was treated conservatively with anticoagulation therapy. She was released after two weeks and followed on an outpatient basis. At two months, she reported decreased abdominal pain and her physical examination was normal. A computed tomography was performed showing a decreased thrombosis size and extent, measuring 80 Ã— 55 mm.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Although rare, surgeons should be made aware of this entity.

SILS has been shown to be a safe and feasible alternative to traditional multiport cholecystectomy, appendectomy, colectomy, and many other laparoscopic procedures. The objective of this study is to provide an initial report of the feasibility of correcting intestinal malrotation via a single-incision laparoscopic transumbilical approach.<br />CASE DESCRIPTION: A 29-year-old woman presented with symptomatic congenital intestinal malrotation. She elected to undergo a Ladd's procedure using a single-incision laparoscopic approach with a SILS port and standard laparoscopic instruments. The procedure was accomplished without additional ports or conversion to laparotomy, and no intraoperative or postoperative complications were noted. Total operative time was 106 minutes. The patient had minimal postoperative pain and was satisfied with the cosmetic outcome.<br />CONCLUSION: When performed by a surgeon experienced in the SILS technique, single-incision laparoscopic Ladd's procedure for symptomatic intestinal malrotation in an adult is feasible and safe, with minimal postoperative pain and favorable cosmetic outcome.","24680157",\N,\N
"1203","Archipelago colonization by ecologically dissimilar amphibians: evaluating the expectation of common evolutionary history of geographical diffusion in co-distributed rainforest tree frogs in islands of Southeast Asia.","Molecular phylogenetics and evolution","Widespread, co-distributed species with limited relative dispersal abilities represent compelling focal taxa for comparative phylogeography. Forest vertebrates in island archipelagos often exhibit pronounced population structure resulting from limited dispersal abilities or capacity to overcome marine barriers to dispersal. The exceptionally diverse Old World tree frogs of the family Rhacophoridae have colonized the forested island archipelagos of Southeast Asia on multiple occasions, entering the islands of Indonesia and the Philippines via a \"stepping stone\" mode of dispersal along elongate island chains, separated by a series of marine channels. Here we evaluate the prediction that two tightly co-distributed Philippine rhacophorids colonized the archipelago during concomitant timescales and in the same, linear, \"island-hopping\" progression. We use a new multilocus dataset, utilize dense genetic sampling from the eastern arc of the Philippines, and we take a model-based phylogeographic approach to examining the two species for similar topological patterns of diversification, genetic structure, and timescales of diversification. Our results support some common mechanistic predictions (a general south-to-north polarity of colonization) but not others (timescale for colonization and manner and degree of lineage diversification), suggesting differing biogeographic scenarios of geographical diffusion through the archipelago and unique and idiosyncratic ecological capacities and evolutionary histories of each species.","24389467","2014","3"

We report the first case of autoimmune pancreatitis associated with spontaneous splenic haemorrhage.<br />CASE REPORT: A 75-year-old man presented with severe epigastric pain radiating to the back associated with nausea and vomiting. A CT-scan of his abdomen showed a large pseudocyst within the pancreatic tail as well as a subcapsular splenic haemorrhage. His IgG4 levels were elevated and clinical history and investigations were consistent with severe acute pancreatitis, but were negative for other known causes of pancreatic disease. The patient was started on steroid therapy and improved dramatically clinically, immunologically and radiologically thus confirming the diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis. His splenic haemorrhage was managed conservatively in view of his haemodynamic stablity and eventually self-resolved.<br />CONCLUSION: Autoimmune pancreatitis should not be overlooked in cases of acute pancreatitis without other obvious etiology.

Questions about missing details were emailed to corresponding authors, and relevant items were then reassessed.<br />RESULTS: Of 137 interventions, only 53 (39%) were adequately described; this was increased to 81 (59%) by using 63 responses from 88 contacted authors. The most frequently missing item was the \"intervention materials\" (47% complete), but it also improved the most after author response (92% complete). Whereas some authors (27/70) provided materials or further information, other authors (21/70) could not; their reasons included copyright or intellectual property concerns, not having the materials or intervention details, or being unaware of their importance. Although 46 (34%) trial interventions had further information or materials readily available on a website, many were not mentioned in the report, were not freely accessible, or the URL was no longer functioning.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Missing essential information about interventions is a frequent, yet remediable, contributor to the worldwide waste in research funding. If trial reports do not have a sufficient description of interventions, other researchers cannot build on the findings, and clinicians and patients cannot reliably implement useful interventions. Improvement will require action by funders, researchers, and publishers, aided by long term repositories of materials linked to publications.","24021722","2013",\N

However investigation and management is sometimes confounded in a pregnant patient. Appendicitis in pregnancy is often managed jointly by both the surgical and obstetric teams, which can lead to discrepant pathways, which may be detrimental to the patient. This review sets out to identify the normal physiological changes of pregnancy that pose diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties to the clinician, assess the more common differential diagnoses and review the current evidence to assist achieving a swift diagnosis and appropriate treatment.<br />METHODS: A literature review of the investigation and management of suspected appendicitis in pregnancy was undertaken. Guidelines by the relevant surgical, obstetric and radiological societies were also reviewed.<br />RESULTS: There remains no consensus on the best diagnostic pathway for appendicitis in pregnancy; which is unsurprising given that appendicitis in non-pregnant patients can yield diagnostic conundrums. However this review identifies a role for MRI scanning as a useful adjunct in these patients. The increasing role of laparoscopy in these patients is also becoming more apparent.<br />CONCLUSION: Appendicitis in pregnancy remains a complex problem necessitating a close working relationship between various specialties to achieve the best outcome for mother and fetus.","24429161","2014","4"

The mainstay of treatment is surgical removal with admission. Recently, antibiotic therapy as an alternative has been introduced and the state of Maryland has incentivized 23-hour procedures. We studied patients with appendicitis discharged from the recovery room and those with length of stay (LOS) less than 24 hours. We retrospectively reviewed all appendectomies performed from June 2010 to October 2012 by three general surgeons. We excluded cases that were converted to open, appendectomies performed in the setting of another disease process, and incidental appendectomies. A total of 84 laparoscopic appendectomies were included. Of these, 55 patients had LOS less than 24 hours. Pathology, comorbidities, and readmission were recorded. Ï‡(2) analysis was used for determining statistical significance. Average LOS for all patients was 25 hours with a minimum stay of 2 hours and a maximum stay of 96 hours. For patients discharged in less than 24 hours, there was one readmission and 52 (95%) of these patients had simple appendicitis on pathology. A total of 19 patients (22%) were discharged in less than 7 hours (from the recovery room). Among these patients, there were no readmissions, and 18 (95%) were cases of simple appendicitis (P = 0.4431). There was no significant difference in complications or readmission between patients discharged in less than 24 hours and those who stayed longer. Our subgroup analysis indicated that discharge from the postanesthesia care unit after uncomplicated laparoscopic appendectomy should be further evaluated.","23896248","2013","8"

Few study investigators have examined potential variation in the burden of periodontitis according to Hispanic or Latino background.<br />METHODS: The authors used a multicenter longitudinal population-based cohort study to examine the periodontal health status at screening (2008-2011) of 14,006 Hispanic and Latino adults, aged 18 to 74 years, from four U.S. communities who self-identified as Cuban, Dominican, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Central American or South American. The authors present weighted, age-standardized prevalence estimates and corrected standard errors of probing depth (PD), attachment loss (AL) and periodontitis classified according to the case definition established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Periodontology (CDC-AAP). The authors used a Wald Ï‡(2) test to compare prevalence estimates across Hispanic or Latino background, age and sex.<br />RESULTS: Fifty-one percent of all participants had exhibited total periodontitis (mild, moderate or severe) per the CDC-AAP classification. Cubans and Central Americans exhibited the highest prevalence of moderate periodontitis (39.9 percent and 37.2 percent, respectively). Across all ages, Mexicans had the highest prevalence of PD across severity thresholds. Among those aged 18 through 44 years, Dominicans consistently had the lowest prevalence of AL at all severity thresholds.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Measures of periodontitis varied significantly by age, sex and Hispanic or Latino background among the four sampled Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos communities. Further analyses are needed to account for lifestyle, behavioral, demographic and social factors, including those related to acculturation.<br />PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Aggregating Hispanics and Latinos or using estimates from Mexicans may lead to substantial underestimation or overestimation of the burden of disease, thus leading to errors in the estimation of needed clinical and public health resources. This information will be useful in informing decisions from public health planning to patient-centered risk assessment.","25082929","2014","8"

This study assessed the validity of the scored patient-generated subjective global assessment (PG-SGA) in adult patients who had undergone an open appendectomy, and examined the association of this assessment tool with length of hospital stay.<br />METHODS: Nutritional status was determined by using the scored PG-SGA in adult patients (n = 86) who had undergone an open appendectomy within 24 hours of admission. Variables were compared between well-nourished and malnourished participants. Regression analysis was used to identify potential predictors for length of hospital stay. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to examine the validity of the PG-SGA score to predict the nutritional status.<br />RESULTS: On admission, 17% of the study subjects were malnourished and associated with a significantly older age (53.0 vs. 39.5), greater PG-SGA score (8 vs. 2), higher comorbidity (67% vs. 27%), and longer length of hospital stay (6.9 d vs. 4.1 d). The PG-SGA score and comorbidity were the determined risk factors for length of hospital stay after performing multiple regression analysis. Furthermore, the PG-SGA score had a significantly positive correlation with length of hospital stay (Spearman's rho = 0.378, p < 0.001). The area under the ROC curve indicating the PG-SGA score, compared with nutritional status, is 0.9751.<br />CONCLUSIONS: The scored PG-SGA in adults receiving an appendectomy is significantly associated with length of hospital stay, and is an effective tool for assessing the nutritional status of patients with cancer and chronic illness, as well as of patients with acute surgical abdomen.","24732661",\N,\N

This article reviews the available literature examining the use of AAPs in the elderly, evaluating their association with weight gain and changes in blood glucose and lipid parameters. We find a relative paucity of studies in this area; while some data highlight significant, collective changes in metabolic parameters, the majority suggests an apparent low vulnerability to these side effects. We conclude that the risk and clinical implications of unfavorable metabolic changes in the elderly being treated with AAP medications remain largely undetermined, and we caution against drawing firm conclusions based on the available data. The conflicting evidence leaves us recommending that metabolic monitoring be implemented, with regular follow-up as advocated in other populations.","24477569","2014","3"

Data retrieved were: signalment, weight, percentage of scapula removed, histologic diagnosis, postoperative limb use, adjunctive therapy, disease free interval (DFI), and survival time (ST). Individual variables were modeled with a Cox proportional hazard model accounting for censoring to determine risk factors for decreased DFI and ST. For categorical variables, Kaplan-Meier survival plots as well as mean and median survival times (MSTs) were calculated.<br />RESULTS: Subtotal scapulectomy was performed in 18 dogs (42.9%). Osteosarcoma (OSA) was diagnosed in 27 dogs (64.3%). Limb use was evaluated immediately after surgery in 41 dogs. Information on limb use at other times (1, 2, 3, and >3 months) postoperatively was also available for some dogs and was good to excellent overall. Only adjunctive chemotherapy had a positive significant effect on DFI (Pâ€‰=â€‰.00011) and ST (Pâ€‰=â€‰.0003).<br />CONCLUSION: Canine scapular tumors can be treated effectively by scapulectomy and limb use is fair to excellent for most dogs.

The frequency of SSI detected after discharge varied between 21% for colectomy and 94% for knee arthroplasty. Independent risk factors for SSI differed between operations. The NNIS risk index was predictive of SSI in gastrointestinal surgery only. Laparoscopic technique was protective overall, but associated with higher rates of organ-space infections after appendicectomy. The duration of participation in the surveillance programme was not associated with a decreased SSI rate for any of the included procedure.<br />CONCLUSION: These data confirm the effect of post-discharge surveillance on SSI rates and the protective effect of laparoscopy. There is a need to establish alternative case-mix adjustment methods. In contrast to other European programmes, no positive impact of surveillance duration on SSI rates was observed.","25063012","2014","9"
"1215","Targeting receptor-activator of nuclear kappaB ligand in aneurysmal bone cysts: verification of target and therapeutic response.","Translational research : the journal of laboratory and clinical medicine","Aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) is a benign tumor of bone presenting as a cystic, expansile lesion in both the axial and appendicular skeleton. Axial lesions demand special consideration, because treatment-related morbidity can be devastating. In similar lesions, such as giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB), the receptor-activator of nuclear kappaB ligand (RANKL)-receptor-activator of nuclear kappaB (RANK) signaling axis is essential to tumor progression. Although ABC and GCTB are distinct entities, they both contain abundant multinucleated giant cells and are osteolytic characteristically. We hypothesize that ABCs express both RANKL and RANK similarly in a cell-type specific manner, and that targeted RANKL therapy will mitigate ABC tumor progression. Cellular expression of RANKL and RANK was determined in freshly harvested ABC samples using laser confocal microscopy. A consistent cell-type-specific pattern was observed: fibroblastlike stromal cells expressed RANKL strongly whereas monocyte/macrophage precursor and multinucleated giant cells expressed RANK. Relative RANKL expression was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in ABC and GCTB tissue samples; no difference in relative expression was observed (P > 0.05). In addition, we review the case of a 5-year-old boy with a large, aggressive sacral ABC. After 3 months of targeted RANKL inhibition with denosumab, magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated tumor shrinkage, bone reconstitution, and healing of a pathologic fracture. Ambulation, and bowel and bladder function were restored at 6 months. Denosumab treatment was well tolerated. Post hoc analysis demonstrated strong RANKL expression in the pretreatment tumor sample. These findings demonstrate that RANKL-RANK signal activation is essential to ABC tumor progression. RANKL-targeted therapy may be an effective alternative to surgery in select ABC presentations.","24726460","2014","8"

We report the case of a 48-year old male, diagnosed with a spontaneous dissection of the celiac trunk extending towards the common hepatic artery. He was treated conservatively and remained asymptomatic after two years of follow-up. Conservative treatment seems justified in the absence of bowel ischemia or signs of hemorrhage. Initial Computed Tomography angiography revealed the presence of a dissection with a pseudoaneurysm that remained stable and regressed towards a normal Computed Tomography angiography after 7 months of follow-up. Radiologic follow-up is warranted as progression of the dissection and/or total occlusion with or without symptoms can occur. The risk factors, the natural course and optimal treatment remain unclear due to the rarity of the disorder. Our patient had no predisposing cardiovascular risk factors. Nevertheless, we observed a hypertrophic ligamentum arcuatum on Computed Tomography, possibly facilitating the evolution towards a dissection.

Hepatic artery anatomic variability may lead to dramatic consequences when unanticipated. A 64-year-old man presented with a 6-cm abdominal aortic aneurysm, suitable for an EVAR procedure. The EVAR procedure was uneventful and the patient was discharged after 2 days. After 2 weeks, he was readmitted for recurrent upper abdominal pain due to acute cholecystitis. The postoperative EVAR computed tomography scan was revisited and the suprarenal bare-metal stent of the Zenith device overlapped the highly calcified origin of both the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and the celiac trunk. Moreover, the patient appeared to have a right replaced hepatic artery originating from the SMA. He developed diffuse, patchy ischemia of both the large and the entire small bowel, and quickly became unresponsive to vasopressor drugs. He died shortly thereafter. An EVAR procedure may result in a highly complicated course when hepatic artery anatomic variability is present. Fenestrated EVAR or proximal graft scallops should be considered for cases in which the proximal sealing zone is diseased and flow to visceral vessels is compromised.","24184463","2014","5"
"1219","Upper-airway stimulation for obstructive sleep apnea.","The New England journal of medicine","BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with considerable health risks. Although continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) can mitigate these risks, effectiveness can be reduced by inadequate adherence to treatment. We evaluated the clinical safety and effectiveness of upper-airway stimulation at 12 months for the treatment of moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea.<br />METHODS: Using a multicenter, prospective, single-group, cohort design, we surgically implanted an upper-airway stimulation device in patients with obstructive sleep apnea who had difficulty either accepting or adhering to CPAP therapy. The primary outcome measures were the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI; the number of apnea or hypopnea events per hour, with a score of â‰¥15 indicating moderate-to-severe apnea) and the oxygen desaturation index (ODI; the number of times per hour of sleep that the blood oxygen level drops by â‰¥4 percentage points from baseline). Secondary outcome measures were the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), and the percentage of sleep time with the oxygen saturation less than 90%. Consecutive participants with a response were included in a randomized, controlled therapy-withdrawal trial.<br />RESULTS: The study included 126 participants; 83% were men. The mean age was 54.5 years, and the mean body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.4. The median AHI score at 12 months decreased 68%, from 29.3 events per hour to 9.0 events per hour (P<0.001); the ODI score decreased 70%, from 25.4 events per hour to 7.4 events per hour (P<0.001). Secondary outcome measures showed a reduction in the effects of sleep apnea and improved quality of life. In the randomized phase, the mean AHI score did not differ significantly from the 12-month score in the nonrandomized phase among the 23 participants in the therapy-maintenance group (8.9 and 7.2 events per hour, respectively); the AHI score was significantly higher (indicating more severe apnea) among the 23 participants in the therapy-withdrawal group (25.8 vs. 7.6 events per hour, P<0.001). The ODI results followed a similar pattern. The rate of procedure-related serious adverse events was less than 2%.<br />CONCLUSIONS: In this uncontrolled cohort study, upper-airway stimulation led to significant improvements in objective and subjective measurements of the severity of obstructive sleep apnea.

The eruption was initially diagnosed as impetigo by his primary care practitioner but progressed despite trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole therapy, with extension to the face, trunk, and all extremities. When the patient subsequently developed a fever of 100.8Â° F, emesis, diarrhea, and upper respiratory symptoms, he was referred to the pediatric dermatology clinic for evaluation. Further questioning revealed a 3-day febrile illness 6 weeks prior to presentation that was treated with ceftriaxone. Review of systems failed to identify any hematuria, blood in stool, or abdominal pain, but the parents did report swelling of the extremities and face, as well as decreased oral intake. On examination, the infant was in no apparent distress, afebrile, and had mild rhinorrhea. His mucous membranes were unaffected, and no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly was noted. Cutaneous exam revealed numerous edematous erythematous to violaceous plaques on the cheeks, arms, buttocks, and legs with minimal involvement of the trunk. Several lesions on the arms had a distinct cockade (rosette or iris-like) pattern. There were no vesicles, bullae, or necrosis. Edema of the bilateral lower extremities was noted. Laboratory work up revealed a normal complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel, creatinine, and urinalysis. Platelets were borderline elevated at 439 TH/Î¼L (140-440 TH/Î¼L), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein (CRP) were minimally elevated at 22 mm (0-15 mm) and 3.1 mg/dL (0.0-0.99 mg/dL), respectively.","24549086","2014","1"

Fulminant hepatic failure, occasionally requiring urgent liver transplantation, is a rare manifestation of AOSD. Here, we present a case of 22-year-old woman with no significant medical history who initially came with fever, arthralgias, myalgias, generalized weakness, and sore throat. Laboratory data showed mildly elevated transaminases and markedly elevated ferritin levels. She was diagnosed with AOSD based on Yamaguchi diagnostic criteria and was started on prednisone. Three months later, while she was on tapering dose of steroid, she presented with fever, abdominal pain, jaundice, and markedly elevated transaminases. Extensive workup excluded all potential causes of liver failure. She was diagnosed with AOSD associated acute liver failure (ALF). Intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone pulse therapy was started, with dramatic improvement in liver function. Our case demonstrated that ALF can present as a complication of AOSD and IV mega dose pulse methylprednisolone therapy can be employed as a first-line treatment in AOSD associated ALF with favorable outcome.","24991218","2014",\N

The patients were 62- and 74-year-old men. The initial symptom was acute febrile abdominal pain. Laboratory tests revealed severe infection (C-reactive protein concentrations were 23.3 Âµg/mL in patient 1 and 22.3 Âµg/mL in patient 2) and multilocular cystic masses (the diameters were 70 mm in patient 1 and 50 mm in patient 2) at the pancreatic head that involved peripancreatic vessels were demonstrated by computed tomography. Laboratory and radiographic findings were markedly improved by endoscopic transpapillary drainage. The enteric bacteria were detected in the drainage specimens. Curative resection was achieved, and histological findings indicated a carcinoma in situ in patient 1 and an invasive carcinoma in patient 2. Neither hyperamylasemia nor histological fat necrosis, frequently observed in acute pancreatitis, was evident. Both patients were free from recurrence after surgery (17 months in patient 1, and 18 months in patient 2). Cyst infection is an unknown complication of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. Transpapillary drainage is highly recommended as an initial intervention. It is difficult to distinguish between cyst infection and unresectable invasive carcinoma with imaging modalities; however, surgical intervention after drainage may contribute to long-term survival.","24622083","2014","4"

We examined the role of expectant observation (EO) in patients who had undergone an initial resection at the time of referral to our center and who had limited residual disease.<br />METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients referred to Mount Sinai/Princess Margaret Hospitals, Toronto, for consideration of surgical management of peritoneal malignancy between January 1998 and December 2009. One hundred and three patients with primary mucinous appendiceal malignancy were identified. EO, consisting of regularly scheduled imaging and clinical review, was selected for asymptomatic patients with low-grade tumor and no/limited disease on imaging. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were determined.<br />RESULTS: Management consisted of supportive care in 7 patients, systemic chemotherapy in 7, referral for CRS with HIPEC in 8, CRS without HIPEC at our center in 51, and EO in 30. In the CRS group, 5-year OS was 74 % and PFS was 56 %; both OS and PFS were predicted by extent of residual disease after cytoreduction (p = 0.014 and p = 0.011, respectively). In the EO group, 5-year OS and PFS were 95 and 82 %, respectively. Two patients in the EO group subsequently underwent CRS for progression on imaging.<br />CONCLUSIONS: In well-selected patients who have undergone initial resection for low-grade mucinous tumor of the appendix with limited peritoneal spread, a formal program of observation can result in excellent 5-year OS and PFS. Longer-term follow-up will help define the benefits and risks of this approach.","24100959","2014","1"

And the recent invention of laparoscopic trans-umbilical-appendectomy is a further improvement of LA. However, it requires expensive instruments with the requisite expertise. We discuss a useful modification of trans-umbilical appendectomy for acute appendicitis using routine instruments.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: From August 2009 to March 2011, 164 patients were operated by this method at our rural center. Out of them, 102 were males and 62, females. Mean age for males was 27.5 years (range, 14-51) and females, 31.2 years (range, 17-48). Mean body mass index was 21.7 kg/m(2) (range, 16.2-29) and 23.2 kg/m(2) (range, 17.4-30) for males and females respectively. Acute appendicitis patients wherein surgery was deemed essential were offered this technique. Three umbilical ports (one 10 mm and two 5 mm) were strategically placed to dissect out appendix. Routine laparoscopic instruments were used for all.<br />RESULTS: Mean operativetime was 45 min (range, 30-90) with 1.8% conversion-rate to conventional laparoscopy. Average blood-loss was 15 ml (range, 10-25). We had one caecal electrosurgical injury, which was managed expectantly. Umbilical sepsis and seroma were 3% and 6.1% respectively. Patients were discharged after an average 1.3 days (range, 1-4). The scars had receded in the umbilicus giving a near-scarless abdomen.<br />DISCUSSION: Recently developed technique of single-port appendectomy has primarily been used for chronic appendicitis. Moreover, >1 inch incision inducted per-umbilicum rises the attendant morbidity. We study a surgeon-friendly simple technique applied to acute appendicitis.<br />CONCLUSION: Method described here is feasible and safe for managing acute appendicitis. It can be learnt rather easily (learning curve of 15 cases) by a laparoscopic surgeon and avoids expensive instrumentation. Thus, it may stand out in providing benefits of modern surgery to population of developing countries.","24470843","2013","1"

Laparoscopy frequency, hospital length of stay, and complications were reviewed.<br />RESULTS: In 2000, 2003 and 2006 appendectomies were done laparoscopically 11.4%, 18.7% and 31.3% of the time, respectively. Children were more likely to undergo LA at a children's hospital (P<0.001). LA complications were less likely overall (OR: 0.80, CI: 0.70-0.92, P=0.002) and in perforated cases (OR: 0.78, CI: 0.67-0.91, P=0.001).

Although available evidence supports the administration of oral anticoagulants with respect to other treatment options to prevent thromboembolism, the use of oral anticoagulation therapy remains suboptimal. The PREFER in AF registry was conducted to evaluate patterns of prescriptions and patient adherence to guidelines, clinical features, quality of life and treatment satisfaction.<br />METHODS: The PREFER in AF registry enrolled consecutive patients with AF recruited in high-volume cardiology centers, with AF documented during the previous 12 months. Patients were assessed at baseline and at 1-year follow-up. The present report provides Italian baseline data compared with data from other European countries participating in the registry.<br />RESULTS: The registry enrolled 1888 Italian patients (out of 7243 in Europe), with an average age of 70.9 years. Main comorbidities included hypertension (73.5%), dyslipidemia (38.7%) and obesity (21.9%). The risk of thromboembolism was assessed using the CHA2DS2-VASc score, according to which only 4.7% of Italian patients scored 0, whereas 11.3% scored 1 and 84% scored â‰¥2. Italy is the Western European country with the lowest use of vitamin K antagonists (71.6%; average rate in Europe: 78.3%) and the highest average INR measurements, whereas time in therapeutic range is 72.2%, lower than in any other Western European country with the exception of Spain. Most Italian patients are unsatisfied with treatment, and only 36% report no difficulties in taking anticoagulation therapy compared with 70.3% of patients in other Western European countries.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Among Western European countries included in the registry, Italy has the lowest prescription rate of vitamin K antagonists and the highest rate of INR measurements. Italian patients also report lower levels of satisfaction with treatment and a higher subjective difficulty in managing anticoagulation therapy. The new oral anticoagulants may favor treatment management, thus having the potential of improving medication adherence and persistence as well as quality of life.","24625849","2014","2"

The patients received a standard KD after fasting for 48 h. The levels of blood ketone, blood glucose and uric ketone were tested daily, and routine blood examination, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, body mass index (BMI), sensory and motor function, and adverse reactions were monitored weekly to assess the safety and feasibility of KD.<br />RESULTS: KD treatment lasted for a mean of 12.9 days (4 to 29 days) in these patients. In all the patients, blood ketone level increased during the fasting and maintained a level above 2.0 mmol/L after taking KD, while the uric ketone level ranged from +++ to ++++. The blood glucose level was in the normal range during KD. Except for blood chloride level and BMI, routine blood test results, electrolytes, liver and kidney function showed no significant changes after KD. No significant changes were observed in the sensation of light touch and pinprick. The average motor ASIA score increased from 33.3 to 35.1 after KD. Gastrointestinal dysfunction (diarrhea, nausea, poor appetite, gastric pain, and abdominal distension) was recorded in 5 patients, hypoglycemia occurred in one patient early after KD, and one patient experienced urticaria during KD. All the adverse reactions were relieved after symptomatic treatments.<br />CONCLUSION: This preliminary clinical trial demonstrated that KD could increase ketone bodies level and maintain a normal blood glucose level, suggesting its safety and feasibility in patients with acute SCI.","24752112","2014","4"

"1237","Treatment results for spontaneous isolated superior mesenteric artery dissection according to our previous guidelines and collective literature review.","Annals of vascular surgery","BACKGROUND: Isolated superior mesenteric artery dissection (ISMAD) is not a rare disease. However, its optimal treatment strategy has not yet been established.<br />METHODS: This study included 13 consecutive patients with ISMAD who were treated between April 2010 and July 2013 according to published treatment guidelines. Through a literature search, 10 studies on treatments and outcomes for ISMAD that were published from 2007 to the present were analyzed.<br />RESULTS: In the present study, 11 patients had acute onset abdominal pain and 2 patients were asymptomatic. Twelve patients were treated with conservative treatment, whereas 1 patient underwent coil embolization. In the literature review, initial conservative treatment, endovascular procedure, and surgical repair were done in 172, 25, and 14 patients, respectively. Bowel resection was done in 8 patients (3.7%) due to bowel necrosis. Conservative treatment failed in 15 patients (6.8%) during follow-up.<br />CONCLUSIONS: If bowel necrosis or arterial rupture was not present, conservative treatment of ISMAD was a safe and effective treatment. Aneurysmal type IV patients on computed tomography scan should be carefully followed up, and if there is a recurrence of pain or aneurysmal progression, an endovascular procedure could be safely performed.","24858595","2014","10"
"1238","A rare case of Amyand's hernia presenting as an enterocutaneous fistula.","Journal of surgical case reports","The finding of the vermiform appendix in an inguinal hernia has an incidence of approximately 1%. The condition is given the eponymous name Amyand's hernia. However in just 0.08% the condition is complicated by an acute appendicitis. The clinical presentation varies, depending on the extent of inflammation of the appendix and is most often misdiagnosed as an incarcerated inguinal hernia. As such it is rarely recognised prior to surgical exploration. We report a case of Amyand's hernia in an 85 year old woman, which presented as a right groin enterocutaneous fistula. CT scanning illustrated a fistulous tract in the right groin, which communicated with the caecum and the peritoneal cavity. She underwent laparotomy, which revealed that the appendix appeared inflamed, lay in the inguinal canal and was the origin of the enterocutaneous communication.","24946340","2010",\N
"1239","Appendicitis: changing perspectives.","Advances in surgery","Neoplasms are an uncommon finding after appendectomy, with malignant tumors occurring in less than 1% of the surgical specimens, and carcinoid being the most frequent malignancy. A negative or inconclusive ultrasound is not adequate to rule out appendicitis and should be followed by CT scan. For pregnant patients, MRI is a reasonable alternative to CT scan. Nonoperative treatment with antibiotics is safe as an initial treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis, with a significant decrease in complications but a high failure rate. Open and laparoscopic appendectomies for appendicitis provide similar results overall, although the laparoscopic technique may be advantageous for obese and elderly patients but may be associated with a higher incidence of intraabdominal abscess. Preoperative diagnostic accuracy is of utmost importance during pregnancy because a negative appendectomy is associated with a significant incidence of fetal loss. The increased morbidity associated with appendectomy delay suggests that prompt surgical intervention remains the safest approach. Routine incidental appendectomy should not be performed except in selected cases. Interval appendectomy is not indicated because of considerable risks of complications and lack of any clinical benefit. Patients older than 40 years with an appendiceal mass or abscess treated nonoperatively should routinely have a colonoscopy as part of their follow-up to rule out cancer or alternative diagnosis.","24298848","2013",\N

The question of feasibility also arises in cases of advanced inflammation with perforation.<br />MATERIAL AND METHODS: Since May 2012 all female patients with suspected acute appendicitis were offered a TVAE as an alternative to the standard procedure. Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative parameters were registered prospectively.<br />RESULTS: Until October 2013 a total of 13 TVAEs had been performed. The median age of the patients was 41 years (range 20-76 years), median BMI was 23.1Â (range 18.1-28.3Â kg/m(2)) and the American Society of Anesthesiologists score (ASA) distribution (I/II/â‰¥â€‰III) was 8/5/0. Histology revealed three cases of perforated, one hemorrhagic necrotizing and seven phlegmonous appendicitis. Furthermore, there were two findings without inflammation, namely one neurogenic appendicopathy and one neuroendocrine tumor. For the three patients with perforated appendicitis, there was a trend for higher age (67.0 years versus 33.5 years, pâ€‰=â€‰0.063) and a higher C-reactive protein (CRP) level on admission (134.4Â mg/l versus 26.4Â mg/l, pâ€‰=â€‰0.043). Also, procedural time and hospital stay were longer (64Â min versus 47Â min, pâ€‰=â€‰0.033 and 14 days versus 3 days, pâ€‰=â€‰0.004, respectively). The former was mostly due to more extensive intraoperative flushing (volume 3000Â ml versus 500Â ml, pâ€‰=â€‰0.013 and duration 13Â min versus 2Â min, pâ€‰=â€‰0.011). None of the cases required conversion but two of the three postoperative complications occurred in patients with perforation, which also resulted in the longer hospital stay.<br />CONCLUSION: Technically, TVAE seems feasible also in cases of perforated appendicitis. However, in these cases procedural time is prolonged due to more extensive flushing. Whether or not the longer hospital stay can be attributed to the perforation or if TVAE results in a higher rate of complications in cases of perforated appendicitis needs further evaluation.","24969344","2014","6"

In animal models, mesenchymal stem cells have been used successfully to regenerate cartilage and bones. However, there have been no follow-up studies on humans treated with adipose-tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) for the chondromalacia patellae. To obtain ADSCs, lipoaspirates were obtained from lower abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue. The stromal vascular fraction was separated from the lipoaspirates by centrifugation after treatment with collagenase. The stem-cell-containing stromal vascular fraction was mixed with calcium chloride-activated platelet rich plasma and hyaluronic acid, and this ADSCs mixture was then injected under ultrasonic guidance into the retro-patellar joints of all three patients. Patients were subjected to pre- and post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Pre- and post-treatment subjective pain scores and physical therapy assessments measured clinical changes. One month after the injection of autologous ADSCs, each patient's pain improved 50-70%. Three months after the treatment, the patients' pain improved 80-90%. The pain improvement persisted over 1 year, confirmed by telephone follow ups. Also, all three patients did not report any serious side effects. The repeated magnetic resonance imaging scans at three months showed improvement of the damaged tissues (softened cartilages) on the patellae-femoral joints. In patients with chondromalacia patellae who have continuous anterior knee pain, percutaneous injection of autologous ADSCs may play an important role in the restoration of the damaged tissues (softened cartilages). Thus, ADSCs treatment presents a glimpse of a new promising, effective, safe, and non-surgical method of treatment for chondromalacia patellae.","23700485","2013",\N
"1243","The effect of the physiological rest position of the mandible on cerebral blood flow and physical balance: an observational study.","Cranio : the journal of craniomandibular practice","Aims: There has been much published evidence that balance can improve by changing the mandible's position relative to the maxilla as it comes together with the teeth (or oral device) as the endpoint. (1 - 10) To help with the complexity of this topic, a definitions table* (in Appendix ) has been included at the end of the manuscript for reference as needed. The aim of the current study is to evaluate whether the physiologic rest position of the jaw* (oral device overtop of the teeth as endpoint where the muscles of mastication are optimized) (11) can have an effect on cerebral blood flow and physical balance using measurable data relative to the person's natural, or habitual bite (teeth as endpoint) in both healthy and diseased volunteers. Methodology: Seven healthy male professional football athletes and two females with multiple sclerosis were included in this observational study, which tested the subjects in both jaw positions. Cerebral blood flow was measured non-invasively by ultrasound over the temporal region of the skull using mean flow velocity (MFV)* and pulsatility index (PI)* of the right and left middle cerebral arteries while the subject clenched the teeth together in both jaw positions. The MFV is the average speed of the blood flow in a given region of a blood vessel. The PI measures cerebral intravascular resistance. Physiologic balance of the whole body was also tested while the subjects were in both jaw positions using the y-excursion balance test* and by videotape. Results: (i) Cerebral blood flow. On the natural teeth, the MFV dropped from baseline to clenching position (mean drop -2Â·6Â±7Â·7 cm/second, whereas, the MFV was slightly enhanced with the physiologic rest position (PRP) [mean enhancement is 0Â·82Â±3Â·7 cm/second (Pâ€Š=â€Š0Â·07)]. At baseline on natural teeth, the PI dropped slightly from baseline to clenching (mean drop 0Â·015Â±0Â·19). Whereas with PRP, the PI dropped by mean of 0Â·059Â±0Â·072 (Pâ€Š=â€Š0Â·15). (ii) Balance. The mean balance measurement while using the PRP was 119Â·54Â±12Â·56 cm (Pâ€Š=â€Š0Â·001), whereas the mean balance measurement on natural teeth was 110Â·72Â±9Â·47 cm. Balance improved subjectively in both MS patients on videotape. Conclusion: The physiologic rest position of the mandible might have an effect on balance by showing a trend (demonstrating a tendency) in enhancing cerebral blood flow as measured by transcranial Doppler. Further studies are needed to confirm this study's finding.","25034768","2014","7"

Here, we identify DLX3 as a central attenuator of adult bone mass in the appendicular skeleton. Dynamic bone formation, histologic and micro-computed tomography analyses demonstrate that in vivo DLX3 conditional loss of function in mesenchymal cells (Prx1-Cre) and osteoblasts (OCN-Cre) results in increased bone mass accrual observed as early as 2 weeks that remains elevated throughout the lifespan owing to increased osteoblast activity and increased expression of bone matrix genes. Dlx3OCN-conditional knockout mice have more trabeculae that extend deeper in the medullary cavity and thicker cortical bone with an increased mineral apposition rate, decreased bone mineral density and increased cortical porosity. Trabecular TRAP staining and site-specific Q-PCR demonstrated that osteoclastic resorption remained normal on trabecular bone, whereas cortical bone exhibited altered osteoclast patterning on the periosteal surface associated with high Opg/Rankl ratios. Using RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation-Seq analyses, we demonstrate that DLX3 regulates transcription factors crucial for bone formation such as Dlx5, Dlx6, Runx2 and Sp7 as well as genes important to mineral deposition (Ibsp, Enpp1, Mepe) and bone turnover (Opg). Furthermore, with the removal of DLX3, we observe increased occupancy of DLX5, as well as increased and earlier occupancy of RUNX2 on the bone-specific osteocalcin promoter. Together, these findings provide novel insight into mechanisms by which DLX3 attenuates bone mass accrual to support bone homeostasis by osteogenic gene pathway regulation.","24948010","2014","9"

It is effective in treating acute and chronic pain of unilateral origin from the chest and abdomen. This technique causes pain relief with pulmonary function preservation and great hemodynamic stability. 66Â year old woman (156Â cm, 80Â kg, BMI 32) with chronic right heart failure, hypertension and obesity, on chronic oxygen therapy was presented for elective mastectomy due to breast cancer. She suffered from severe COPD and also bullous emphysema. FVC 1.59Â l; FEV1 0.55Â l; FEV1%FVC 34.6. The paravertebral block was performed using the multi-shot percutaneous technique with additional light general anesthesia. For confirmation, of proper analgesia range, control of temperature changes, using FLIR i7 infrared camera, was performed. Control photos were made 20Â min after the blockade and then 10Â min later. Infrared photo showed rise of temperature reading in every marked region. There were no hemodynamic and pulmonary complications postoperatively. Paravertebral block in combination with sedation creates excellent conditions for breast surgery procedures. Additional temperature changes monitoring performed with infrared camera may confirm proper range of analgesia needed to perform surgery. Great cardiovascular stability and very good pulmonary function preservation make this method excellent for high risk patients. Low complication rate is additional advantage.

Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D is characterized by febrile attacks, often associated with transient digestive manifestations, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. Here we report for the first time 2 patients with MKD revealed by severe neonatal colitis. Both patients had chronic bloody diarrhea and failure to thrive; 1 patient since the age of 1 month and the other since the age of 12 days. Total parenteral nutrition was required. A marked elevation of acute phase reactants was present, and no evidence of infection was found. In patient 1, ileocolonoscopy revealed ulcerative colitis at the age of 5 months. Patient 2 suffered from enterocolitis and shock, associated with multiple bowel adhesions at age 5 weeks; the rectosigmoidoscopy showed aphtoid lesions of the sigmoid colon. Pathologic findings of colonic biopsies revealed a dense polymorph inflammatory infiltrate associated with deep ulcerations. Febrile attacks occurred 2 months after the onset of digestive symptoms in patient 1, and at onset of disease in patient 2. Genomic sequencing of the mevalonate kinase gene revealed compound heterozygous mutations in both patients. Anti-interleukin-1 agent produced long-term remission of all digestive features and laboratory parameters. This report emphasizes that MKD may be the cause of severe early-onset inflammatory colitis, and must be considered by physicians, even in the absence of fever, after ruling out infections.

Results were compared to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 2008 survey on transitional care.<br />RESULTS: Over half (158/288, 55%) of CARRA members completed the survey. Fewer than 10% are very familiar with AAP guidelines about transition care for youth with special healthcare needs. Eight percent have a formal written transition policy, but 42% use an informal approach. Patient request (75%) most frequently initiates transfer to adult care. Two major barriers to transition are fragmented adult medical care and lack of sufficient time to provide services. Compared with AAP survey participants, pediatric rheumatology providers are significantly more likely to help youth find an adult specialist (63% vs 45%) and discuss confidentiality and consent before age 18 (45% vs 33%), but are less likely to help with medical summary creation (16% vs 27%) or find a primary care provider (25% vs 47%).

Hence, there is a pressing need to develop additional therapeutics against schistosomiasis. The antimalarial drug mefloquine shows antischistosomal activity in animal models and clinical trials, which calls for further investigations.<br />METHODOLOGY: We comparatively assessed the efficacy and tolerability of the following treatments against Schistosoma haematobium in school-aged children in CÃ´te d'Ivoire: (i) praziquantel (40 mg/kg; standard treatment); (ii) mefloquine (25 mg/kg) combined with praziquantel (40 mg/kg); and (iii) mefloquine-artesunate (3Ã— (100 mg artesunate +250 mg mefloquine)) combined with praziquantel (40 mg/kg) (treatments administered on subsequent days). Two urine samples were collected before, and on days 21-22 and 78-79 after the first dosing.<br />PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sixty-one children were present on all examination time points and had complete datasets. No difference in efficacy was observed between the three treatment groups on either follow-up. On the 21-22 day posttreatment follow-up, based on available case analysis, cure rates of 33% (95% confidence interval (CI) 11-55%), 29% (95% CI 8-50%), and 26% (95% CI 5-48%) were observed for praziquantel, mefloquine-artesunate-praziquantel, and mefloquine-praziquantel, respectively. The corresponding egg reduction rates were 94% and above. On the second follow-up, observed cure rates ranged from 19% (praziquantel) to 33% (mefloquine-artesunate-praziquantel), and egg reduction rates were above 90%. Praziquantel monotherapy was the best tolerated treatment. In the mefloquine-artesunate-praziquantel group, adverse events were reported by 91% of the participants, and in the mefloquine-praziquantel group, 95% experienced adverse events. With the exception of abdominal pain at moderate severity, adverse events were mild.<br />CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The addition of mefloquine or mefloquine-artesunate does not increase the efficacy of praziquantel against chronic S. haematobium infection.

Short half-life is a limitation for p-cymene application and several approaches have been used to improve pharmaceutical properties of monoterpenes, including the employment of drug-delivery systems. Here, we used p-cymene/Î²-cyclodextrin (Î²-CD) complex and p-cymene (PC) isolated to evaluated whether the complex formulation is able to improve the antinociceptive activity of this monoterpene. Male mice (26-30g) were pretreated with PC/Î²-CD (20 or 40mg/kg, p.o.), PC (20 or 40mg/kg, p.o.) or vehicle (distilled water), 0.5h before painful tests and antinociceptive effect was evaluated at times: 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16h after treatment. We evaluated the analgesic-like effect of PC/Î²-CD and PC in acetic acid-induced abdominal writhes, hot-plate, carrageenan-induced paw edema and in rota-rod apparatus. Our results demonstrated that acute treatment with complex PC/Î²-CD produced an antinocicepitve effect (p<0.01 or p<0.001) for 8h followed whereas isolated PC produced the same effect for 2h. Similar results were obtained in hot-plate test, PC/Î²-CD, in all doses, significantly reduces (p<0.01 or p<0.001) nociceptive behavior for 8h while isolated PC for 1h, did so only in higher dose. Such results were unlikely to be caused by motor abnormality. Systemic pretreatment with PC/Î²-CD and PC inhibited the development paw edema by carrageenan 1%, but PC/Î²-CD did so during a longer period when compared with isolated monoterpene alone. Our results provide evidence to propose that the complex with Î²-CD improved analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of p-cymene.","23357360","2013","3"
"1263","Peritoneal malignant mesothelioma metastatic to supraclavicular lymph nodes.","International journal of surgical pathology","Distinguishing between malignant mesothelioma and reactive mesothelial hyperplasia is often inestimable, but may be a challenging gauntlet for pathologists. A 62-year-old man underwent appendectomy after the identification of a peritoneal mass and the histological examination showed mesothelial proliferation along the appendix surface with no clear images of infiltration. After a few months the patient developed mediastinal and supraclavicular lymphadenopathies, and a nodal biopsy showed mesothelial cell proliferation invading lymphatic sinuses, consistent with the cells seen in the abdominal cavity. Since overt morphologic criteria for malignancy were lacking and reactive mesothelial cell deposits have been documented in lymph nodes, a molecular investigation of the CDKN2A (henceforth simply p16) gene status via fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed, which showed homozygous deletion in 100% tumor cells. These data ruled out the hypothesis of reactive mesothelial cells inclusion in lymph nodes, thus confirming the diagnosis of epithelioid malignant mesothelioma.","24474244","2014","9"
"1264","Comorbidity burden and perioperative complications for living kidney donors in the United States.","Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Since 1998, 35% of kidney transplants in the United States have been derived from living donors. Research suggests minimal long-term health consequences after donation, but comprehensive studies are limited. The primary objective was to evaluate trends in comorbidity burden and complications among living donors.<br />DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) was used to identify donors from 1998 to 2010 (n=69,117). Comorbid conditions, complications, and length of stay during hospitalization were evaluated. Outcomes among cohorts undergoing appendectomies, cholecystectomies and nephrectomy for nonmetastatic carcinoma were compared, and sample characteristics were validated with the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR). Survey regression models were used to identify risk factors for outcomes.<br />RESULTS: The NIS captured 89% (69,117 of 77,702) of living donors in the United States. Donor characteristics were relatively concordant with those noted in SRTR (mean age, 40.1 versus 40.3 years [P=0.18]; female donors, 59.0% versus 59.1% [P=0.13]; white donors, 68.4% versus 69.8% [P<0.001] for NIS versus SRTR). Incidence of perioperative complications was 7.9% and decreased from 1998 to 2010 (from 10.1% to 7.6%). Men (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20 to 1.56) and donors with hypertension (AOR, 3.35; 95% CI, 2.24 to 5.01) were more likely to have perioperative complications. Median length of stay declined over time (from 3.7 days to 2.5 days), with longer length of stay associated with obesity, depression, hypertension, and pulmonary disorders. Presence of depression (AOR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.12), hypothyroidism (AOR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.11), hypertension (AOR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.27 to 1.49), and obesity (AOR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.11) increased over time. Complication rates and length of stay were similar for patients undergoing appendectomies and cholecystectomies but were less than those with nephrectomies for carcinoma.<br />CONCLUSIONS: The NIS is a representative sample of living donors. Complications and length of stay after donation have declined over time, while presence of documented comorbid conditions has increased. Patients undergoing appendectomy and cholecystectomy have similar outcomes during hospitalization. Monitoring the health of living donors remains critically important.","24071651","2013","10"

We report a case of a 5-year-old girl presenting with an acute abdomen who had omental torsion caused by a giant lipoma of the greater omentum, which was diagnosed by a computed tomography scan. Laparoscopy revealed a yellow tumor of the greater omentum with a smooth surface. Tumor excision and partial omentectomy was performed to treat the torsion, and the tumor was retrieved through a 4-cm-wide abdominal incision. Macroscopically, the specimen was 80 Ã— 60 Ã— 25 mm in size and 74.8 g in weight, and histopathological findings were consistent with the diagnosis of lipoma. The present case highlights the possible use of laparoscopic surgery for removing large abdominal lipomas, thus avoiding the drawbacks of laparotomy in terms of postoperative pain and prolonged hospital stay.","25037302","2014",\N

We report the case of a 4-year-old girl with fever and vomiting for 48h, brought to the university hospital of Grenoble because of vigilance disorders, loss of verbal fluency, and a cerebellar syndrome. She had a biological infectious syndrome. Infectious encephalitis was suggested first, but the cerebral scan and the lumbar punction were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a diffuse brain edema with extended involvement of cortical and basal ganglia. The electroencephalogram was globally slow. The infectious syndrome was explained by perforated appendicitis with peritonitis, treated by surgery and antibiotic therapy. Other infectious explorations were negative. No metabolic or autoimmune diseases were found. Hence, our final diagnosis was sepsis-associated encephalopathy. After 1 year of follow-up care, her clinical exam, MRI, and EEG were normal. Sepsis-associated encephalopathy has been increasingly described in the adult population, but until today only three pediatric cases have been published. It is diagnosed when the patient has a severe infectious syndrome associated with neurologic symptoms, mostly vigilance or consciousness disorders, no signs of shock, and only when other potential reasons have been ruled out. The MRI shows non-specific diffuse lesions with vasogenic edema on the subcortical substance or on the basal ganglia and the thalami. The electroencephalogram is slowed down on the whole. The main differential diagnoses are infectious encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and cerebral vasculitis. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is an MRI diagnosis that presents characteristics similar to SAE. In the future, it could be discovered that it is the same physiopathology. At the moment, we only treat the symptoms and the causative infection. Most of the time, patients have neurologic sequelae that affect their verbal fluency. It can persist from a few months up to 6yrs. Although quite slow, the neurologic progression is good. The mechanisms are studied and there are hopes for specific treatments. The main explanation seems to be immune with alterations of the blood-brain barrier. Cytokines and activated leukocytes may attack the cerebral substance.","23953625","2013","10"

Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Annual Conference","When undertaking gait-analysis, one of the most important factors to consider is heel-strike (HS). Signals from a waist worn Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) provides sufficient accelerometric and gyroscopic information for estimating gait parameter and identifying HS events. In this paper we propose a novel adaptive, unsupervised, and parameter-free identification method for detection of HS events during gait episodes. Our proposed method allows the device to learn and adapt to the profile of the user without the need of supervision. The algorithm is completely parameter-free and requires no prior fine tuning. Autocorrelation features (ACF) of both antero-posterior acceleration (aAP) and medio-lateral acceleration (aML) are used to determine cadence episodes. The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) features of signal peaks during cadence are extracted and clustered using Swarm Rapid Centroid Estimation (Swarm RCE). Left HS (LHS), Right HS (RHS), and movement artifacts are clustered based on intra-cluster correlation. Initial pilot testing of the system on 8 subjects show promising results up to 84.3%Â±9.2% and 86.7%Â±6.9% average accuracy with 86.8%Â±9.2% and 88.9%Â±7.1% average precision for the segmentation of LHS and RHS respectively.","24109847","2013",\N

Part B, Molecular and developmental evolution","The axolotl is becoming one of the most used model organisms in developmental and regenerative studies but no publication has described in detail the development of its forelimb and hindlimb muscles. We describe and illustrate the ontogeny of these muscles in transgenic axolotls that express GFP in muscle fibers and discuss our results and data previously obtained by us and by other authors about limb regeneration in axolotls and ontogeny in frogs and other tetrapods. Our observations and comparisons: (1) demonstrate radio-ulnar and ventro-dorsal morphogenetic gradients in the order of axolotl forelimb muscle formation and differentiation, while in axolotl hindlimb ontogeny there are only proximo-distal and tibio-fibular gradients; some of the axolotl gradients are therefore different from the ulno-radial/fibulo-tibial fore- and hindlimb and the dorso-ventral hindimb ontogenetic morphogenetic gradients seen in frogs and amniotes such as chickens; (2) provide a potential explanation for the usual presence, in both limbs of taxa from all major tetrapod groups, of more radial/tibial muscles than ulnar/fibular muscles; (3) support the \"in-out\" developmental mechanism of appendicular muscle formation; (4) offer new insights about the ancestral Bauplan of tetrapod limbs, including the striking similarity of the zeugopodial (forearm/leg) and autopodial (hand/foot) muscles of the two limbs and the ventro-dorsal symmetry of the zeugopodial muscles of a same limb; and (5) provide further evidence to corroborate the hypothesis that these similarities are due to derived homoplastic events that occurred during the fins-limbs transition and not due to forelimb-hindlimb serial homology.","24302552","2014","2"

A 22 year old man with a past medical history of ethylene glycol suicidal poisoning was admitted to a Acad. N. Kipshidze Central University Clinic in Tbilisi, four months after deliberate intravenous injection of an unknown quantity of metallic mercury from several thermometers into his antecubital vein. After 2 months of asymptomatic period, the patient began to complain of pain and tremor in limbs, fatigue and skin rash. CT scan of the thorax and the abdomen confirmed multiple small opacities of metallic density in both lungs, liver and right kidney. After the procedure the patient was transferred to the toxicology center in Baku, Azerbaijan for chelation therapy. On arrival no biochemical abnormalities in hepatic or renal function or clinical pulmonary malfunction were detected, despite presence of slight symptoms of erethism, tremor mercuralis, knee joints arthralgia and lower extremities weakness. Chelation therapy with intramuscular injection of Unithiol (DMPS) was started in dose of 20mg/kg/day. After one month of chelation therapy, mercury blood concentration slowly decreased from initially 134 microgram/L to 105 microgram/L. This case report demonstrates mild acute toxicity following intravenous administration of unknown amounts of elemental mercury. Because of chelation therapy can remove approximately 1 mg of mercury per day the patient was recommended further long-term DMPS treatments under the control blood mercury levels. It is concluded that clinical manifestations of intravenous elemental mercury intoxication may be delayed despite significant increase in blood mercury level.","24523325","2014","1"

Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences","BACKGROUND: It has been hypothesized that insulin resistance plays a role in the development of the loss of skeletal muscle; however, no cohort studies on insulin resistance and low relative appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) have been published to date. Thus, we examined whether insulin resistance is associated with low relative ASM after a 4.6-year follow-up period among apparently healthy older men and women participants.<br />METHODS: This is a combined retrospective-prospective cohort study, which includes 147 community-dwelling older men and women participants. ASM was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline and follow-up. Participants with a relative change in ASM below the sex-specific 15th value were classified as the low relative ASM group. Homeostatic model assessment was used to quantify insulin resistance. Logistic regression calculated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for development of low relative ASM, adjusted for covariates.<br />RESULTS: The loss of ASM in the low relative ASM and normal groups was -1.8kg and -0.35kg, respectively (p â‰¤ .05). The low relative ASM group was older and had higher insulin and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance values at baseline. The risk of developing low relative ASM at 4.6-year follow-up was 2.9 times higher (95% CI, 1.00-7.8; p = .04) among the participants with homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance levels more than 2.3. After adjusting for age, the risk increased to 3.9 times higher (95% CI, 1.3-11.5; p = .03).<br />CONCLUSION: Insulin resistance was associated with low relative ASM at 4.6-year follow-up after accounting for several covariates in a cohort of apparently healthy, well-functioning young older men and women.","24325896","2014","7"

It almost originates from a primary appendiceal tumor with different malignancy degrees. The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcome and long-term survival on 80 patients affected by PMP after cytoreductive surgery (CRS) associated with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).<br />METHODS: From October 1995 to June 2012, about 550 operations for PC were performed; in 300 cases surgical cytoreduction in association with HIPEC was carried out. Regarding PMP, 80 procedures of CRS and HIPEC were performed. This approach is based on surgical removal of the primitive cancer, peritonectomy (stripping of implants on the peritoneal surface) and HIPEC performed with cisplatinum and C mytomicin. The rationale of this treatment is to obtain, after macroscopic disease removal, an elevated and persistent drug concentration in the peritoneal cavity, with limited systemic effects.<br />RESULTS: The complication rate was 52.5% (42/80) with no postoperative deaths. The median overall and progression-free survival were 144 and 88 months, respectively. Not complete cytoreductive surgery (P<0.001), tumor histology (P=0.02) and previous systemic chemotherapy (p = 0.03) were identified in the univariate analysis as independent predictors for a poorer long-term survival. In the multivariate analysis, the completeness of cytoreduction was the only significant variable influencing the outcome. Incomplete cytoreduction (P<0.01) resulted the only statistically significant variable associated with a higher incidence of postoperative complications.<br />CONCLUSION: PMP can be treated with curative intent in a large percentage of cases by cytoreductive surgery associated with HIPEC. This new approach could be performed safely with acceptable morbidity and mortality in selected patients treated in specialized centers. Completeness of cytoreduction allows to achieve the best results.","24193289","2013","12"

In a second step, we assumed that patients hospitalized for <3 d would have been eligible for day-case surgery. We then compared patients hospitalized for â‰¤3 d with those hospitalized for >3 d in terms of demographic data, laboratory test results, and surgical procedures.<br />RESULTS: The study population comprised 86 men and 82 women (median age: 57 y; age range: 18-90 y). Contraindications for day-case surgery were identified preoperatively in 23% of the cases (39 of 168) and intraoperatively in another 23% of the cases. The proportion of patients hospitalized for <3 d was 41% (69 of 168) when considering the intention-to-treat population and 57% (51 of 90) when considering patients with no contraindications to day-case surgery. Forty percent of the patients hospitalized for â‰¥3 d (16 of 39) suffered from postoperative pain that was poorly controlled by oral analgesics.

Studies have demonstrated that PEM providers are able to identify an array of diseases, including intussusception, pyloric stenosis and appendicitis. Novel applications of ultrasound, such as a cardiac evaluation in the acutely ill patient or identification of skull fractures in the assessment of a patient with head injury, have shown excellent promise in recent studies. These novel applications have the potential to reshape pediatric diagnostic algorithms.<br />SUMMARY: Key applications in PEM have been investigated in the recent publications. Further exploration of the ability to integrate ultrasound into routine practice will require larger-scale studies and continued growth of education in the field. The use of ultrasound in clinical practice has the potential to improve safety and efficiency of care in the pediatric emergency department.","24786367","2014","6"

A total of 53 consecutive patients were enrolled and evaluated. We also compared the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatments, and clinical results of left PEA with those of left ACD.<br />RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients and twenty-five patients were diagnosed with symptomatic left PEA and ACD, respectively. The patients with left PEA had focal abdominal tenderness on the left lower quadrant (82.1%). On CT examination, most (89.3%) of the patients with left PEA were found to have an oval fatty mass with a hyperattenuated ring sign. In cases of left ACD, the patients presented with a more diffuse abdominal tenderness throughout the left side (52.0% vs 14.3%; P = 0.003). The patients with left ACD had fever and rebound tenderness more often than those with left PEA (40.0% vs 7.1%, P = 0.004; 52.0% vs 14.3%, P = 0.003, respectively). Laboratory abnormalities such as leukocytosis were also more frequently observed in left ACD (52.0% vs 15.4%, P = 0.006).<br />CONCLUSION: If patients have left-sided localized abdominal pain without associated symptoms or laboratory abnormalities, clinicians should suspect the diagnosis of PEA and consider a CT scan.","24187459","2013","10"

"1283","Effect of electron beam on chemical changes of nutrients in infant formula.","Food chemistry","Infant milk formula has recently been implicated as a transmission vehicle for an emerging foodborne pathogen, Enterobacter sakazakii, resulting in high mortality rates. Electron beam (e-beam) efficiently and non-thermally inactivates foodborne pathogens, including E. sakazakii, in infant milk formula. However, the effects of e-beam on chemical changes of nutrients in infant formula have not been determined. Therefore, the objective of this study was to fulfill this gap. Dehydrated infant milk formula was processed with e-beam at 0 (control) to 25 kGy. Amino acid, fatty acid, and mineral profiles (AAP, FAP, and MP, respectively), as well as protein degradation and lipid oxidation, were determined. There were no differences (P>0.05) in FAP, AAP, and MP. SDS-PAGE electrophoresis qualitatively detected three major protein bands in all samples up to 25 kGy. Densitometry analysis of SDS-PAGE gels confirmed no size degradation (P>0.05) as a function of increased e-beam dose. Totol-volatile-basic-nitrogen (TVBN) excluded (P>0.05) protein degradation due to microbial activity. There was no increase (P>0.05) in lipid oxidation, as assessed with thiobarbituric-reactive-substances (TBARS), except in samples processed at 25 kGy. Dehydrated formula has low water activity, which likely protected nutrients from e-beam-induced chemical changes. This study demonstrates that proteins, lipids, and minerals in infant milk formula are stable when processed with e-beam up to 25 kGy at low temperature and under anaerobic conditions.","24295697","2014","4"

Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is caused by obstruction of hepatic venous outflow and is the leading cause of postsinusoidal liver failure. We present a rare case of BCS caused by a simple hepatic cyst. A 16 cm Ã— 16 cm liver cyst was found on computed tomography of a 66-year-old woman presenting with abdominal pain. The cyst had become infected, thus enlarged, exerting mass effect with almost complete compression of the inferior vena cava. Shortly after admission, the patient developed acute liver failure, with deranged clotting and hepatic encephalopathy requiring full organ support on the intensive care unit. Cardiac output studies showed a low cardiac index of 1.4 l/min/m(2). An emergency laparotomy with fenestration of the cyst and drainage of 2l of purulent material led to a full recovery. Intraoperative cystic fluid aspirates later confirmed no evidence of Echinococcus. Histology confirmed a simple cyst. Liver biopsies showed severe, confluent, bridging necrosis, without background parenchymal liver disease. Acute BCS due to rapid compression of all major hepatic veins leading to fulminant hepatic failure is rare.

All cases from then through 12/2012 were captured for quality assessment monitoring. The distance from the hospital to patients' homes was determined using http://maps.google.com. Procedures were categorized as simple (TLH+/-BSO) or complex (TLH+/-BSO with sentinel node mapping, pelvic and/or aortic nodal dissection, appendectomy, or omentectomy). Urgent care center (UCC) visits and readmissions within 30days of surgery were captured, and time to the visit was determined from the initial surgical date.<br />RESULTS: Same-day discharge was planned in 200 cases. Median age was 52years (range, 30-78), BMI was 26.8kg/m(2) (range, 17.4-56.8), and ASA was class 2 (range, 1-3). Median distance traveled was 31.5miles (range, 0.2-149). Procedures were simple in 109 (55%) and complex in 91 (45%) cases. The indication for surgery was: endometrial cancer (n=82; 41%), ovarian cancer (n=5; 2.5%), cervical cancer (n=8; 4%), and non-gynecologic cancer/benign (n=105; 53%). One hundred fifty-seven (78%) had successful same-day discharge. Median time for discharge for these cases was 4.8h (range, 2.4-10.3). Operative time, case ending before 6pm, and use of intraoperative ketorolac were associated with successful same-day discharge. UCC visits occurred in 8/157 (5.1%) same-day discharge cases compared to 5/43 (11.6%) requiring admission (P=.08). Readmission was necessary in 4/157 (2.5%) same-day discharge cases compared to 3/43 (7.0%) requiring admission (P=.02).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Same-day discharge after robotic-assisted hysterectomy for benign and malignant conditions is feasible and safe.","24736022","2014","6"
"1291","Preoperative assessment and treatment of appendiceal mucocele complicated by acute torsion: a case report.","BMC research notes","BACKGROUND: Mucus-producing tumours of the appendix or mucoceles can, if left untreated, lead to dissemination of its contents into the peritoneal cavity causing substantial morbidity to the patient. Symptoms for complicated mucoceles can mimic those of acute appendicitis and the final diagnosis is most likely made intraoperatively. We here present a case that is, to our knowledge, one of only ten described in the literature and the first to characterize torsion of an appendiceal mucocele with abdominal magnetic resonance imaging.<br />CASE PRESENTATION: The patient, a 34-year-old Caucasian female presented at the emergency department with acute abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant. Initial diagnostic work-up including ultrasonography and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging showed a large tubular mass at the base of the appendix with indirect signs of torsion. A laparoscopic appendectomy was performed the following day where the finding was confirmed. The patient went on to have an uneventful recovery and was discharged from the hospital on the first postoperative day.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance imaging is a useful tool in identifying unknown lesions of the appendix and should be considered the primary imaging modality in especially younger patients requiring diagnostic imaging. In this case the preoperative imaging findings aided in choosing the correct timing and treatment option for the patient.","24382056","2014",\N
"1292","The microbiology of bacterial peritonitis due to appendicitis in children.","Irish journal of medical science","AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the microbiology of secondary bacterial peritonitis due to appendicitis and the appropriateness of current antimicrobial practice in one institution.<br />METHODS: A 14-year retrospective single-centre study of 69 consecutive paediatric patients (age 1-14 years) with appendicitis-related peritonitis and positive peritoneal specimen cultures was conducted. Post-operative outcomes, microbiology and antibiotic susceptibility of peritoneal isolates were analysed in all patients.<br />RESULTS: Escherichia coli was identified in 56/69 (81 %) peritoneal specimens; four isolates were resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate, and one other isolate was resistant to gentamicin. Anaerobes were identified in 37/69 (54 %) peritoneal specimens; two anaerobic isolates were resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and one isolate was resistant to metronidazole. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified in 4/69 (6 %) peritoneal specimens, and all were susceptible to gentamicin. Streptococcal species (two Group F streptococci and three Î²-haemolytic streptococci) were identified in 5/69 (7 %) specimens, and all were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate. Combination therapy involving amoxicillin-clavulanate and aminoglycoside is appropriate empirical treatment in 68/69 (99 %) patients. Addition of metronidazole to this regime would provide 100 % initial empirical coverage. Inadequate initial empiric antibiotic treatment and the presence of amoxicillin-clavulanate resistant E. coli were independent predictors of the post-operative infectious complications observed in 14/69 (20 %) patients.<br />CONCLUSION: E. coli and mixed anaerobes are the predominant organisms identified in secondary peritonitis from appendicitis in children. Inadequate initial empirical antibiotic and amoxicillin-clavulanate resistant E. coli may contribute to increased post-operative infectious complications. This study provides evidence-based information on choice of combination therapy for paediatric appendicitis-related bacterial peritonitis.","24346630","2014","12"
"1293","Surgical high ligation of the ovarian vein and preservation of ovarian function for twisted ovarian tumors.","Chinese medical journal","BACKGROUND: Appendectomy is the traditional surgical procedure for correcting torsion of the adnexa. Although it prevents pulmonary embolism, ovarian necrosis, and secondary infection, it can have critical adverse effects on the ovarian function.<br />METHODS: We performed surgery for adnexal torsion in 12 patients, using high ligation of the ovarian vein, followed by removal of the ovarian tumor.<br />RESULTS: Blood flow in the residual ovary gradually returned to normal within 1 - 3 months, and a dominant follicle could be seen in the residual ovary within 2 - 6 months post-surgery in all the 12 cases. Menstruation recovered in these three cases within 2 - 3 months. Postoperative intrauterine pregnancies occurred in two cases, with a corpus luteum graviditatis in the residual ovary in one case, while the other patient underwent labor after 13 months and a normal ovary on the affected side was seen at cesarean section.<br />CONCLUSIONS: This new surgical technique involving high ligation of the ovarian vein for adnexal torsion allowed successful preservation of the residual ovary and ovarian blood distribution, and can thus be used for the treatment of primary diseases of the ovary. The surgical procedure is simple, safe, and effective, and warrants extensive application in clinical practice.","23075736","2012","10"
"1294","Perirenal space blocking restores gastrointestinal function in patients with severe acute pancreatitis.","World journal of gastroenterology : WJG","AIM: To investigate effects of perirenal space blocking (PSB) on gastrointestinal function in patients with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP).<br />METHODS: Forty patients with SAP were randomly allocated to receive PSB or no PSB (NPSB). All the SAP patients received specialized medical therapy (SMT). Patients in the PSB group received PSB + SMT when hospitalized and after diagnosis, whereas patients in the NPSB group only received SMT. A modiï¬ed gastrointestinal failure (GIF) scoring system was used to assess the gastrointestinal function in SAP patients after admission. Pain severity (visual analog scale, 0 to 100) was monitored every 24 h for 72 h.<br />RESULTS: Modified GIF score decreased in both groups during the 10-d study period. The median score decrease was initially significantly greater in the PSB group than in the NPSB group after PSB was performed. During the 72-h study period, pain intensity decreased in both groups. The median pain decrease was significantly greater in the PSB group than in the NPSB group at single time points. Patients in the PSB group had significantly lower incidences of hospital mortality, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and pancreatic infection, and stayed in the intensive care unit for a shorter duration. However, no difference in terms of operation incidence was found between the two groups.<br />CONCLUSION: PSB could ameliorate gastrointestinal dysfunction or failure during the early stage of SAP. Moreover, PSB administration could improve prognosis and decrease the mortality of SAP patients.","24379596","2013","12"

Their median pre-surgery level of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA-199) was 80.95 U/ml (range 0.00-1,562.10 U/ml); of carbohydrate antigen 12-5 (CA-125), 44.00 U/ml (range 0.90-231.20 U/ml); and of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), 17.20 ng/ml (range 2.04-211.60 ng/ml). Of the 35 patients, 23 (65.7 %) underwent cytoreductive surgery (CRS) by gynecological oncologists and 12 (34.3 %) underwent non-CRS surgeries by general gynecologists or surgeons, including one patient who refused surgical treatment beyond a diagnostic laparoscopy. After surgery, 18 patients (51.4 %) had residual lesions, 11 (31.4 %) had complete lesion removal and 6 (17.1 %)had insufficient information on residual lesion; 21 (60.0 %) had appendiceal-based tumors and 12 (34.3 %) had ovarian-based tumors. Median follow-up time was 37 months (range 1-148 months), during which 28 patients (80.0 %) had relapsed. By the end of the study, 12 patients (34.3 %) died of PMP, 16 (45.7 %) survived with disease, and 7 (20 %) survived without disease. Median progress-free survival (PFS) was 12 months (range 0.5-114.0 months). Median overall survival time was 42 months (range 5-150 months). Ovarian tumor origin, post-surgery residual lesions, preoperative CA199 > 258.9 U/ml and CA125 > 70.6 U/ml were independent predictors of PFS.<br />CONCLUSIONS: PMP is rare in women, and has a poor long-term survival rate.

"1297","An assessment of pain management among patients presenting to emergency medical services after suffering a fall.","Prehospital and disaster medicine","INTRODUCTION: Emergency Medical Services (EMS) professionals frequently care for patients experiencing acute pain. Analgesics are critical in patient comfort and satisfaction levels during the treatment of acute pain. The objective of this study was to assess the frequency of pain management in patients suffering a fall, the documented pain score, and the location of their injuries. It was hypothesized that the frequency of analgesia administration was low and would be associated with injury location.<br />METHODS: This was a retrospective review of patients presenting with a complaint of an injury from a fall transported by a single municipal EMS system. Administration of analgesia was the primary outcome variable, with pain severity, injury location, age, gender, race, and distance of fall the independent variables of interest. Pain severity was assessed using a 0-10 scale. Injury location was defined as head/neck, extremities, back, and hip. Patients were deemed ineligible for analgesia, according to local protocol, if they reported chest or abdominal pain, or were hemodynamically unstable as determined by an assessment of pulse and blood pressure.<br />RESULTS: There were 1,200 patients who were classified as having injuries suffered from a fall, with 76 (6.3%) ineligible for analgesia. Ninety-two (8.2%) patients received analgesia, and they had a mean recorded pain score of 9.1 (95% CI, 8.7-9.5), which was higher than those who did not receive analgesia (5.8; 95% CI, 5.5-6.2). Analgesia administration was associated with injury location; patients experiencing an extremity injury (OR = 13.23; 95% CI, 5.58-31.36; P < .001) or hip injury (OR = 11.65; 95% CI, 4.64-29.24; P < .001) had increased odds of analgesia administration compared to those with head/neck injury. The odds of analgesia administration were decreased for black patients (OR = 0.19; 95% CI, 0.08-0.44; P < .001) when compared to white patients.<br />CONCLUSION: Analgesia administration was provided to 10% of eligible patients, and was associated with injury location. Of concern was the number of patients who suffered a fall and did not receive a documented pain score. The results from this study indicated a need for education relating to pain management in patients suffering a fall.","24945749","2014","8"
"1298","Perforated appendicitis: an underappreciated mimic of intussusception on ultrasound.","Pediatric radiology","BACKGROUND: We encountered multiple cases in which the US appearance of ruptured appendicitis mimicked intussusception, resulting in diagnostic and therapeutic delay and multiple additional imaging studies.<br />OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical and imaging discriminatory features between the conditions.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: Initial US images in six children (age 16Â months to 8Â years; 4 boys, 2 girls) were reviewed independently and by consensus by three pediatric radiologists. These findings were compared and correlated with the original reports and subsequent US, fluoroscopic, and CT images and reports.<br />RESULTS: All initial US studies demonstrated a multiple-ring-like appearance (target sign, most apparent on transverse views) with diagnostic consensus supportive of intussusception. In three cases, US findings were somewhat discrepant with clinical concerns. Subsequently, four of the six children had contrast enemas; two were thought to have partial or complete intussusception reduction. Three had a repeat US examination, with recognition of the correct diagnosis. None of the US examinations demonstrated definite intralesional lymph nodes or mesenteric fat, but central echogenicity caused by debris/appendicolith was misinterpreted as fat. All showed perilesional hyperechogenicity that, in retrospect, represented inflamed fat \"walling off\" of the perforated appendix. There were four CTs, all of which demonstrated a double-ring appearance that correlated with the US target appearance, with inner and outer rings representing the dilated appendix and walled-off appendiceal rupture, respectively. All six children had surgical confirmation of perforated appendicitis.<br />CONCLUSION: Contained perforated appendicitis can produce US findings closely mimicking intussusception. Clinical correlation and careful multiplanar evaluation should allow for sonographic suspicion of perforated appendicitis, which can be confirmed on CT if necessary.","24463638","2014","5"
"1299","Left paraduodenal hernia combined with acute cholecystitis.","Annals of surgical treatment and research","Paraduodenal hernia is a rare congenital malformation. Management consists of reduction of the herniated intestine and repair of the defect. A 74-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department with persistent right upper quadrant pain that began 3 hours ago. Physical examination revealed tenderness at right upper quadrant of abdomen. Computed tomography revealed multiple gallstones with gallbladder wall thickening, marked dilatation of stomach and duodenum and a sac-like mass of small bowel loops to left of ligament of Treitz suggesting acute cholecystitis and left paraduodenal hernia. Laparoscopic exploration of abdomen was performed and cholecystectomy, bowel reduction, and closure of defect with intracorporeal interrupted suturing were performed. For left paraduodenal hernia without bowel necrosis, laparoscopic reduction of incarcerated bowel and closure of hernial orifice are technically feasible and may be the surgical method of choice because of its minimal invasiveness and aesthetic advantage.","24783182","2014","4"

All patients had acute abdominal pain, two had intra-abdominal hemorrhage and bleeding shock. Three patients underwent elective \"trapping\" embolization of the celiac trunk with Amplatzer vascular plugs in the hepatic and splenic artery and celiac trunk, and coils in left gastric artery. One patient had a splenic artery rupture and underwent selective embolization of this vessel with platinum-fiber coils.<br />RESULTS: Angiography and postoperative CT scan confirmed artery occlusion after embolization in all cases. Revascularization of celiac trunk branches was obtained via collaterals. No procedure-related adverse events occurred during follow-up (median, 4.5 months; range, 3-24 months) and vessel occlusion was maintained.<br />CONCLUSION: Isolated and symptomatic dissecting aneurysm of the celiac trunk can be successfully managed by embolization techniques with good short- to mid-term results.","24226294","2014","11"

Intramural location was confirmed either on surgery or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). Depending upon the symptoms, their control with the conservative medical therapy and procedural consent, the patients underwent EUS guided single time aspiration of the pseudocyst or transmural drainage or transpapillary drainage or surgery.<br />RESULTS: A total of 9 patients with intra mural pseudocysts (male: n = 8; mean age Â± SD: 39.3 Â± 8.0 years; age range: 24-54 years; five patients having chronic and four patients having acute pancreatitis) were studied. The pseudocysts were located in the wall of the second part of the duodenum in five patients, in the gastric wall in three patients and in the lower esophageal wall in one patient. The size of the pseudocysts ranged from 8 mm to 8 cm and 3/9 (33%) patients had associated extra mural pancreatic pseudocysts. All patients had abdominal pain on presentation. Along with pain the patients with duodenal intramural pseduocysts also had symptoms suggestive of gastric outlet obstruction (3) or jaundice (1). The patient with esophageal intramural pseudocyst had dysphagia along with abdominal pain. Majority of these patients could be successfully treated endoscopically with no significant complications.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Intramural pseudocysts of the upper GIT are very rare and EUS is a useful investigational modality for diagnosing and treating them.","24949395","2013","10"

All of these patients were diagnosed using either a serologic test for Anisakiasis (n = 18) or by pathology (n = 1). Their medical records were reviewed in order to determine the clinical findings. CT images were retrospectively reviewed by two radiologists to evaluate the characteristics of the involved bowel wall and the ancillary findings.<br />RESULTS: All patients had presented with the acute onset of severe abdominal pain as well as a history of having recently eaten raw fish. The mean time interval from eating the fish to the onset of abdominal pain was 1.7 days. Eighteen patients were treated conservatively and experienced resolution of their symptoms within seven days of hospitalization. One patient underwent surgical exploration for presumed small-bowel ischemia. The sites of involvement included the ileum (16/19, 84%) and jejunum (3/19, 16%). All patients had circumferential bowel-wall thickening (mean, 0.8 cm) with an intermediate length of involved bowel (mean, 7.9 cm). Small-bowel obstruction occurred in 16 patients (84%). The target sign was present in 17 patients (89%), ascites, particularly in the perilesional area, in 16 patients (84%), and mesenteric edema in 15 patients (79%).<br />CONCLUSION: Small-bowel Anisakiasis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen in order to avoid unnecessary surgery when patients present with abdominal pain after having recently eaten raw fish, concentric bowel-wall thickening with the target sign in the ileum, perilesional ascites, as well as bowel obstruction seen on CT.","24562690","2014","6"

"1305","Transiliopsoas approach: an alternative route to drain pelvic abscesses in children.","Pediatric radiology","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an alternative route of pelvic abscess drainage in children via a transiliopsoas approach.<br />BACKGROUND: Appendiceal perforations complicated by inflammatory masses, such as abscesses or phlegmon, are a common indication for abdominal drainage in pediatric interventional radiology. Certain locations of collections may present particular challenges for the operator, owing to numerous surrounding structures, including bowel and other pelvic anatomy. This series describes an alternative route for drainage, which involves traversing the iliopsoas muscle under US guidance to drain a deep pelvic abscess.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed of the transiliopsoas approach for abscess drainage during a 5-year period. The technique, pre- and post-drainage imaging, aspiration/drain output, duration of catheter dwell, procedure-related complications and abscess recurrence were reviewed.<br />RESULTS: Transiliopsoas needle placement was successful in 14 of 14 patients (100%). Catheter placement was successful in 13 patients. Abscess wall rupture precluded catheter placement in one patient. Mean catheter duration was 4.9Â days, with a range of 2 to 9Â days. Clinical improvement was achieved in all 14 patients (100%). There were no major complications. Post-procedure pain with ambulation was reported in 3 of 14 patients (21.4%), which was successfully controlled in each case with medication, and resolved after 2Â days.<br />CONCLUSION: The transiliopsoas route is a safe and effective route for US-guided abscess drainage and catheter placement in children with deep pelvic collections. In selected cases, this approach provides a more easily accessible and safer route than more traditional interventional approaches.","25008801","2015","1"

Fourteen patients had spontaneous abdominal dissections, while 7 dissections were iatrogenic in origin. Thirteen patients with symptomatic acute (n=9) or subacute (n=4) lesions underwent analgesic therapy and medical management of systolic blood pressure for at least 5 days; persistent pain was an indication for endovascular treatment. Eight patients with chronic dissections were treated by endovascular means for co-existent (1) abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) that was >5 cm in diameter or had expanded >5 mm in 6 months (n=6) or (2) rupture-threatening penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU, n=2) even with a diameter <5 cm. Mean dissection length was 45Â±12 mm (range 18-98). Ten patients received tube stent-grafts, 9 had bifurcated endografts, one had an aortouni-iliac (AUI) endoprosthesis, and one patient was treated with a bare metal stent. Follow-up included computed tomographic angiography within 1 month postoperatively, duplex ultrasound at 3 and 6 months, CTA at 12 months, and then annual duplex scans.<br />RESULTS: Early (30-day) mortality was 0%; no major adverse events occurred during hospitalization. Patients with co-existent AAA/PAU had complete exclusion of the aneurysm sac. The patient with an AUI graft suffered from an early stent-graft thrombosis in the abdominal aorta; flow was restored after transfemoral thrombectomy and balloon angioplasty of the common iliac artery. During a mean 73Â±22-month follow-up (range 19-144), 3 patients died due to unrelated causes (95% survival at a median 67 months estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis). All patients showed full aortic remodeling over a period of 12 years. One patient with AAA underwent surgical conversion due to persistent type II endoleak (95% freedom from reintervention at a median 67 months).<br />CONCLUSION: In this series, long-term evaluation of endovascular IAAD treatment found no mortality, few complications, and rare need for secondary interventions.","24754294","2014","4"
"1307","Intermittent adult ileocecal intussusception: a case report and review of literature.","Acta clinica Belgica","We report the case of a 56-year-old male patient who was admitted to the emergency department with crescendo abdominal pain since 2 weeks. In the past 2 years, similar but less pronounced episodes were present, each time resolving spontaneously after spasmolytic drugs. Abdominal ultrasound revealed an ileocecal intussusception. An attempt for preoperative reduction was partially successful. A colonoscopy was performed and showed a tubulovillous adenomatous polyp with high-grade dysplasia, but subsequent right hemicolectomy revealed an underlying cecal adenocarcinoma. The combination of the low incidence and the non-specific symptoms of ileocecal intussusception in the adult makes this entity difficult to diagnose. In most cases, modern imaging techniques such as CT scan, ultrasound, or MRI make the correct preoperative diagnosis. Especially when colonic involvement is present, suspicion of a malignant lead point (i.e. culprit lesion) is primordial. The therapeutic strategy depends on several variables and asks for a patient-tailored, selective approach mostly involving surgery. Based on this case and a short review of literature, we discuss the clinical presentation, diagnostic tools, treatment, and challenges of adult ileocecal intussusception.","24635405",\N,\N

Although any artery can be affected, fibromuscular dysplasia most commonly affects the renal and carotid arteries. Fibromuscular dysplasia of the renal arteries usually presents with hypertension, while carotid or vertebral artery disease causes transient ischemic attacks, strokes, or dissection. Fibromuscular dysplasia of the brachial arteries is extremely uncommon. It can induce extremity ischemia, nerve compression, or both-causing coldness, discoloration, pain, ulceration or gangrene of the fingers, paresthesias, or paralysis. We report a rare case of multivessel fibromuscular dysplasia manifested by acute stroke in association with type I aortic dissection, which progressed rapidly to ascending aortic false aneurysmal development that necessitated arch replacement. Outcomes of aortic arch replacement in this setting are currently unknown. Therefore, our case might well offer some insight.","23467036","2013",\N

We hypothesized that transcriptional signatures of host blood could be used to distinguish tuberculosis from other diseases in African children who either were or were not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).<br />METHODS: The study population comprised prospective cohorts of children who were undergoing evaluation for suspected tuberculosis in South Africa (655 children), Malawi (701 children), and Kenya (1599 children). Patients were assigned to groups according to whether the diagnosis was culture-confirmed tuberculosis, culture-negative tuberculosis, diseases other than tuberculosis, or latent tuberculosis infection. Diagnostic signatures distinguishing tuberculosis from other diseases and from latent tuberculosis infection were identified from genomewide analysis of RNA expression in host blood.<br />RESULTS: We identified a 51-transcript signature distinguishing tuberculosis from other diseases in the South African and Malawian children (the discovery cohort). In the Kenyan children (the validation cohort), a risk score based on the signature for tuberculosis and for diseases other than tuberculosis showed a sensitivity of 82.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 68.6 to 94.3) and a specificity of 83.6% (95% CI, 74.6 to 92.7) for the diagnosis of culture-confirmed tuberculosis. Among patients with cultures negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis who were treated for tuberculosis (those with highly probable, probable, or possible cases of tuberculosis), the estimated sensitivity was 62.5 to 82.3%, 42.1 to 80.8%, and 35.3 to 79.6%, respectively, for different estimates of actual tuberculosis in the groups. In comparison, the sensitivity of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for molecular detection of M. tuberculosis DNA in cases of culture-confirmed tuberculosis was 54.3% (95% CI, 37.1 to 68.6), and the sensitivity in highly probable, probable, or possible cases was an estimated 25.0 to 35.7%, 5.3 to 13.3%, and 0%, respectively; the specificity of the assay was 100%.<br />CONCLUSIONS: RNA expression signatures provided data that helped distinguish tuberculosis from other diseases in African children with and those without HIV infection.

"1310","Impact of aggressive histology and location of primary tumor on the efficacy of surgical therapy for peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal origin.","Annals of surgical oncology","BACKGROUND: Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion (HIPEC) for peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) of colorectal origin increases survival (OS) compared to systemic chemotherapy alone. Signet ring histology demonstrates aggressive behavior with poor survival. We sought to determine whether CRS/HIPEC increases survival in this subset of patients.<br />METHODS: We reviewed 67 patients with PC of appendiceal (AP, n = 37) or colorectal origin (CRC, n = 30) with signet cell histology from a prospective database between May 2001 and August 2011. Survival analysis and multivariate Cox regression were used to determine prognostic factors for survival.<br />RESULTS: Complete CRS (CC-0/1) was achieved in 77 % (CRC) and 73 % (AP) of patients. Progression-free survival (PFS) and OS were 9 and 12 months in CRC and 12 and 21 months in AP patients. In the CRC group, univariate predictors of poor survival included female gender, age, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, preoperative albumin, completeness of cytoreduction, and morbidity. In a multivariate Cox regression model, incomplete cytoreduction (CC-2/3) and female gender were joint significant predictors of poor survival. In the AP group, significant univariate predictors of poor survival included higher EBL and PCI score. In a multivariate Cox regression model, blood loss of >500 ml and a body mass index of <25 kg/m(2) were joint significant predictors of poor survival.<br />CONCLUSIONS: AP signet cell tumors demonstrate a more favorable outcome than CRC signet cell tumors after CRC/HIPEC for carcinomatosis, suggesting an underlying difference in biology. CRS/HIPEC does not confer survival benefit in colorectal signet ring carcinomatosis unless complete cytoreduction can be achieved, whereas appendiceal signet ring carcinomatosis may benefit, regardless of resectability.","24201745","2014","5"

She was afebrile, and haemodynamically stable, and the initial diagnosis was acute appendicitis. A transvaginal ultrasound scan was performed and was suggestive of appendicitis. The patient failed to improve with conservative management, and a laparosocopic appendicectomy was performed the next day to remove an inflamed, non-perforated appendix. Pelvic laparoscopy was performed, which noted normal ovaries and uterus, as well as a hard, swollen, discoloured epiploic appendage of the sigmoid colon. A decision was made not to remove the inflamed epiploic appendage. Postoperatively the patient complained of persisting pain, which settled over 2 days with analgesia and antibiotics. This case is an extremely unusual case of epiploic appendagitis and acute appendicitis. It demonstrates the importance of pelvic laparoscopy in all females with presumed appendicitis, even in the presence of an initial pathology.","23897384","2013",\N

"1314","Familial Mediterranean Fever","GeneReviews(Â®)","DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) comprises two phenotypes: type 1 and type 2. FMF type 1 is characterized by recurrent short episodes of inflammation and serositis including fever, peritonitis, synovitis, pleuritis, and, rarely, pericarditis and meningitis. The symptoms and severity vary among affected individuals, sometimes even among members of the same family. Amyloidosis, which can lead to renal failure, is the most severe complication. FMF type 2 is characterized by amyloidosis as the first clinical manifestation of FMF in an otherwise asymptomatic individual.<br />DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of FMF is suspected in individuals with recurrent episodes of fever associated with abdominal pain (peritonitis) and/or pleuritic pain and/or arthritis (ankle/knee) usually lasting two to three days. A high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), leukocytosis, and a high serum concentration of fibrinogen are characteristic. MEFV is the only gene in which pathogenic variants are currently known to cause FMF. Affected individuals may have biallelic MEFV pathogenic variants or a heterozygous MEFV pathogenic variant.<br />MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Treatment of an acute episode is mainly supportive, including administration of intravenous saline for hydration and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), paracetamol, or dipyrone for pain relief; treatment of febrile and inflammatory episodes with NSAIDs; routine treatment of end-stage renal disease, including live related-donor renal transplantation. Prevention of primary manifestations: Homozygotes for the p.Met694Val pathogenic variant or compound heterozygotes for p.Met694Val and another disease-causing allele require lifelong treatment with colchicine (1-2 mg/day orally in adults and 0.5-1 mg/day in children according to age and weight). Colchicine prevents the inflammatory attacks and the deposition of amyloid. Individuals who do not have the p.Met694Val pathogenic variant and who are only mildly affected (those with infrequent inflammatory attacks) should either be treated with colchicine or monitored every six months for the presence of proteinuria. Surveillance: Annual physical examination, urine spot test for protein, and evaluation for hematuria for all affected individuals including those treated with colchicine; consider monitoring of acute-phase reactants (ESR and fibrinogen levels) at regular intervals during attack-free periods, particularly in those with the p.Met694Val pathogenic variant. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Possible worsening of symptoms with cisplatin; possible adverse effect on renal transplant graft survival with cyclosporin A. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Offer molecular genetic testing to all first-degree relatives and other family members (regardless of symptoms) especially when the p.Met694Val allele is present because renal amyloidosis can be prevented with colchicine treatment.<br />GENETIC COUNSELING: FMF is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, although recent studies have suggested that some heterozygotes manifest a spectrum of findings from classic FMF to mild FMF. For autosomal recessive FMF: In general, both parents of an affected individual with biallelic MEFV pathogenic variants are unaffected heterozygotes. However, in populations with a high carrier rate and/or a high rate of consanguineous marriages, it is possible that one or both parents have biallelic pathogenic variants and are affected. Symptomatic heterozygotes have also been reported. Thus, it is appropriate to consider molecular genetic testing of the parents of the proband to establish their genetic status. If both parents are heterozygotes, the risk to sibs of inheriting two pathogenic variants and being affected is 25%. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the MEFV pathogenic variants in the family are known.","20301405","1993",\N

Patients were initially identified via ICD-9 code for AP (577.0); diagnosis was confirmed by chart review using established diagnostic criteria (presence of two of the following: typical abdominal pain, elevated lipase/amylaseÂ >3 times normal, or imaging findings of pancreatitis). Abdominal CT or MRI obtained in the ED and within 24Â h of admission was reviewed by a fellowship-trained abdominal radiologist.<br />RESULTS: Of 101 patients admitted with AP (60 women, 41 men; mean age 52Â years, range 20-89), 63 (62.4%) underwent imaging; only one (1.6%) showed pancreatic necrosis. 88 (87.1%) patients could have been clinically diagnosed without imaging based on presence of abdominal pain and elevated laboratory values; 13 (12.9%) required imaging for diagnosis. Of 88 patients who met AP diagnostic criteria without imaging, 50 (56.8%) nonetheless underwent imaging, with AP without necrosis seen in 34 (68.0%), pancreatic necrosis in one (2.0%), sequelae of prior AP in four (8.0%), and no abnormality in 11 (22.0%).<br />CONCLUSION: Early imaging is common in patients with AP, even when the diagnosis can be established based on non-imaging criteria, rarely demonstrating pancreatic necrosis. Reducing overuse of early imaging in patients with confident diagnosis of AP may improve quality and reduce waste.","25078061","2014","7"

An ultrasound scan suggested strangulated Spigelian hernia unrelated to the operative wound. Exploration of the wound and mini-laparotomy showed no evidence of wound dehiscence or a hernia, but revealed an inflamed appendix wrapped up with omentum. Appendectomy led to complete recovery of the patient. It is imperative to maintain a high index of suspicion for acute appendicitis in this situation to avoid septic complications that might adversely affect the residual renal function and cause negative impact on kidney donation.

"1320","Clusterin expression in gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumours is highly correlated with location and is helpful in determining the origin of liver metastases.","Histopathology","AIMS: Clusterin (CLU) is a sulphated glycoprotein implicated in many physiological and pathological processes, including tumorigenesis. We have previously demonstrated that CLU is highly expressed in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). The aims of this study were: to investigate CLU expression in gastrointestinal NETs; the potential correlation between this expression and different clinicopathological parameters; and its usefulness in the differential diagnosis of liver metastases.<br />METHODS AND RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry using an anti-CLU antibody was performed on paraffin sections from 108 primary NETs [G3 (13 cases), G2 (18 cases), and G1 (77 cases), according to the 2010 WHO classification] and 60 metastases. Cytoplasmic positivity was scored qualitatively and quantitatively. The pattern of staining was also assessed. Two-step statistical analyses (univariate and multivariate logistic regression) were performed. More than 90% of small-intestine NETs were completely negative. The probability of obtaining a positive CLU score was higher for the appendix, the stomach, the duodenum and the rectum than for the small intestine and colon. All G3 NETs and most G2 NETs were negative as compared with G1. CLU expression in the metastatic foci was identical to that of the primary tumour.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Clusterin expression in gastrointestinal NETs is highly correlated with location and probably also with grading, in both the primary tumour and metastases. Underexpression of CLU in small-intestine NETs is helpful for identifying the origin of liver metastases: a strong CLU score in a liver biopsy makes the small intestine highly unlikely as a primary site.","24807631","2014","11"

This study was based on data from the 2008-2010 Korea National Health and Nutritional Examination Surveys (KNHANES). The subjects included 1,308 men and 1,171 women over 65 yr. Bone mineral density (BMD) and appendicular skeletal muscle (ASM) were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and appendicular skeletal muscle was adjusted by height as a marker of sarcopenia. After confirming the correlation between low muscle mass and BMD, the best cut-off value of muscle mass to estimate osteoporosis was suggested through the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. For both men and women, BMD correlated positively with low muscle mass when ASM/Ht(2) was used as a marker for sarcopenia. The ROC curve showed that ASM/Ht(2) was the best marker for osteoporosis at a cut-off value of 6.85 kg/m(2) for men and 5.96 kg/m(2) for women. When these cut-off values were used to determine sarcopenia, the risk of osteoporosis increased 4.14 times in men and 1.88 times in women. In particular, men (OR 2.12) with sarcopenia were more greatly affected than women (OR 1.15), even after adjusting for osteoporosis risk factors. In elderly Korean people, sarcopenia is positively correlated with BMD and there is a strong correlation between sarcopenia and osteoporosis with risk of bone fracture.","25045234","2014","7"

"1331","Surgical and nonsurgical management of gallstones.","American family physician","Cholelithiasis, or gallstones, is one of the most common and costly of all the gastrointestinal diseases. The incidence of gallstones increases with age. At-risk populations include persons with diabetes mellitus, persons who are obese, women, rapid weight cyclers, and patients on hormone therapy or taking oral contraceptives. Most patients are asymptomatic; gallstones are discovered incidentally during ultrasonography or other imaging of the abdomen. Asymptomatic patients have a low annual rate of developing symptoms (about 2% per year). Once symptoms appear, the usual presentation of uncomplicated gallstones is biliary colic, caused by the intermittent obstruction of the cystic duct by a stone. The pain is characteristically steady, is usually moderate to severe in intensity, is located in the epigastrium or right upper quadrant of the abdomen, lasts one to five hours, and gradually subsides. If pain persists with the onset of fever or high white blood cell count, it should raise suspicion for complications such as acute cholecystitis, gallstone pancreatitis, and ascending cholangitis. Ultrasonography is the best initial imaging study for most patients, although additional imaging studies may be indicated. The management of acute biliary colic mainly involves pain control with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or narcotic pain relievers. Oral dissolution therapy is usually minimally successful and used only if the patient cannot undergo surgery. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains the surgical choice for symptomatic and complicated gallstones, with a shorter hospital stay and shorter convalescence period than open cholecystectomy. Percutaneous cholecystostomy is an alternative for patients who are critically ill with gallbladder empyema and sepsis.","24866215","2014","5"

Once surgery decision was taken, patient underwent an intervention of cystopericystectomy. On the 8th postoperative day, the procedure was complicated by black stool, jaundice, and severe anaemia. Acomputed tomography revealed an inhomogeneous collection with some air bubbles in the area of previous surgical intervention, but it was not able to solve the diagnosis question. At this stage a magnetic resonance study was mandatory. On T2-weighted images we observed an expanse gallbladder with hypointense intraluminal material and a considerable intrahepatic biliary system dilatation due to bloody material. On the basis of these examination results, we supposed haemobilia arising from previous surgical intervention. A therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedure led to decompression of biliary system through a major papilla sphincterotomy with spillage of bile mixed with blood clots.","24455379","2013",\N
"1334","Thermodynamics of imidazole-ligand binding to Ni-nitrilotriacetate in solution and covalently attached to agarose beads: imidazole, his-6 (his-tag) peptide and a new bis-imidazolo-dithiane.","Protein expression and purification","A new imidazolo- and thiol-containing ligand is prepared and characterized with the intent to serve as surrogate and mimic for the canonical ligands imidazole and hexa-histidinyl peptide (his-6) in immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) [1,2] systems. The affinity of this ligand: 1,8 bis (N1,N1')imidazolo-octa-(3,6)-dithiane or bImOdS, to Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) complex in solution is measured and compared with that of imidazole and his-6 peptide via isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). In addition, bImOdS is compared with his-6 binding to the solid-state matrix of Ni-NTA-charged agarose beads, as employed routinely in IMAC. Results reported here include the following: (1) two imidazole moieties bind within a single Ni-NTA complex, while bImOds, being an imidazolo dimer, binds with 1:1, and his-6 peptide binds with 1:3 stoichiometry. (2) Enthalpies of reaction for imidazole and his-6 peptide are reported - these can be utilized to predict changes in affinity in IMAC systems with temperature, should protein unfolding/refolding steps in purification be desired at alternate temperatures. (3) Metal analyses of the Ni-NTA agarose beads suggests that âˆ¼2/3 of the nickel is present in low-affinity sites, which will complicate protein separations at high protein-concentration loading. An improved procedure for subtracting ligand dilution heats from ITC analyses is presented in an Appendix.","24291569","2014","3"

Three-hundred and thirty-two patients (291 men and 41 women) from 19 to 63years performed an abdominal and back muscle endurance test after completing some psychosocial questionnaires. During the endurance tests, surface electromyography signals of the internal obliques, the external obliques, the lumbar multifidus and the iliocostalis were recorded. Patients were dichotomized as underperformers and good performers, by comparing their real endurance time, to the expected time of endurance derived from the normalized median frequency slope. Independent t-tests were performed to examine the differences on the outcome of the questionnaires. In the back muscle endurance test, the underperformers had significantly lower (p<0.05) scores on some of the physical subscales of the SF-36. The underperformers group of the AE test scored significantly higher on the DRAM MZDI (p=0.018) and on the PCS scale (p=0.020) and showed also significantly lower scores on the SF-36 (p<0.05). Back muscle endurance tests are influenced by physical components, while abdominal endurance tests seem influenced by psychosocial components.","24956968","2014","10"
"1336","Pediatric IBS: an overview on pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment.","Pediatric annals","Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder in children and adults. The pathogenesis and pathophysiology of IBS remains incompletely understood. The biopsychosocial model, which conceptualizes chronic pain as a dysregulation of the gut-brain-homeostasis with peripheral and central factors mutually influencing each other, is the most accepted framework to explain IBS. Twin and family aggregation studies suggest a genetic component that does not exclusively explain the higher prevalence of IBS in certain families. Social learning (environmental factors) and maladaptive coping predispose children to develop IBS with greater disability and more frequent medical consultations. Early-life events constitute an additional risk factor for the development of IBS and other functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). Children with a history of cow's milk protein hypersensitivity or abdominal surgeries have a higher prevalence of IBS and other FGIDs years later. IBS frequently follows an episode of acute gastrointestinal inflammation (infectious or non-infectious).

The PCQ was distributed utilizing electronic postings, and predetermined e-mail lists to nurses and physicians across the US.<br />RESULTS: The convenience sample included 617 respondents to the questionnaire. All incomplete responses (failure to answer all 17 items on the questionnaire) were excluded from data analysis. Our major finding was that disruptive behavior was the greatest problem observed in 82% of organizations; 74% personally witnessed these behaviors, while 5% personally experienced these behaviors. Friedman analysis of variance (ANOVA) analyses demonstrated that the difference between these three estimates were significant (Ï‡(2) = 207.8 df = 2, P < 0.0001).<br />CONCLUSION: Healthcare organizations in the US are bound by TJC regulations to develop leadership standards that address disruptive behavior. These organizations can no longer stand by and ignore behaviors that threaten not only the bottom line of the institution, but also most critically, patient safety. As more attention is being paid to recommendations and mandates from the TJC and the Institute of Medicine (IOM), we will need more data, like those provided from this study, to better document how to address, resolve, and prevent future \"misbehaviors\".","24340236","2013",\N

"1344","Active elimination of the marine biotoxin okadaic acid by P-glycoprotein through an in vitro gastrointestinal barrier.","Toxicology letters","The consumption of okadaic acid (OA) contaminated shellfish can induce acute toxic symptoms in humans such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain; carcinogenic and embryotoxic effects have also been described. Toxicokinetic studies with mice have shown that high cytotoxic doses of OA can pass the gastrointestinal barrier presumably by paracellular passage. However, in vitro studies using human intestinal Caco-2 cell monolayers to represent the intestinal barrier have shown that at low-dose exposure OA is transported against a concentration gradient suggesting an active efflux mechanism. Since P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transports a wide variety of substrates, we investigated its possible influence on the observed elimination of OA. We used two different cellular transwell models: (i) Caco-2 cell monolayer endogenously expressing human P-gp and simulating the intestinal barrier and (ii) MDCK-II cell monolayer stably over-expressing P-gp. Our study demonstrates clearly that OA at non-cytotoxic concentrations passes the monolayer barrier only to a low degree, and that it is actively eliminated by P-gp over the apical membrane. Therefore, our in vitro data indicate that humans appear to have efficient defense mechanisms to protect themselves against low-dose contaminated shellfish by exhibiting a low bioavailability as a result of active elimination of OA by P-gp.","24374049","2014","3"

"1346","Drainage of periappendiceal abscess and removal of free fecalith-extraperitoneal approach.","International surgery","Abstract Treatment of complicated acute appendicitis is controversial. The dilemma is further complicated by presence of free fecalith in a well-circumscribed abscess, which has been repeatedly demonstrated to be a major predicting factor of treatment failure of nonoperative treatment of acute appendicitis complicated with appendiceal abscess. If left behind after drainage of the abscess, further operations for removal of retained fecalith or recurrence of abscess might be required. However, little had been stressed over the significance of removal of the free fecalith when it was first encountered. We report our experience of drainage of appendiceal abscess and removal of free fecalith by taking an extraperitoneal approach. Both of our cases made a smooth recovery without any complication or recurrence after a 2-year follow-up. Treatment with this approach avoids many of the complications associated with formal laparotomy. Unlike image-guided drainage or laparoscopic drainage, this procedure is relatively simple and straightforward and can be performed in any level of hospital, including private practitioners and in less well-developed areas and countries. With proper case selection, we recommend this approach as one of the alternatives in the treatment of late-presenting appendiceal abscess with free fecalith.","25058769",\N,\N

Chemical denervation is commonly used in clinical practice for treatment of chronic non-cancer associated pain.<br />OBJECTIVE: To report a case of spinal cord injury resulting from fluoroscopically guided intercostal blocks with phenol.<br />STUDY DESIGN: Case report.<br />SETTING: Inpatient hospital service. RESULTS/CASE REPORTS: A 53 year-old women was transferred from her local facility for acute onset of lower extremity paresis beginning shortly after right intercostal nerve injections of 2 mL of preservative-free phenol at the T7, 8, 9 levels. She had previous intercostal blocks for chronic right-sided mid thoracic/abdominal pain every 3 months for at least one year without sequelae. Within 20 minutes of the injection, she developed a sensation of right leg weakness and heaviness. Over several hours she developed worsening right leg weakness, and then left leg weakness, followed by urinary retention. Admission examination revealed severe right greater than left leg weakness, right lower extremity hyperesthesia to T10, absent lower extremity reflexes, and bilateral extensor plantar responses. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the entire spine demonstrated extensive T2/DWI hyperintensity in the central spinal cord from T1 to L1 with mild cord enlargement and enhancement at T7-9 (sites of injection). Extensive serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluation did not show any evidence of an infectious, inflammatory, or metabolic cause to her myelopathy.

Delayed or absent reporting may negatively impact patient management. In well-resourced countries there is recognition that extending the role of radiographers to radiological reporting tasks helps meet service demands. Aim. To determine the accuracy of acute fracture detection by South African radiographers working in an after-hour setting.<br />METHOD: We performed a retrospective study of radiographers at a Western Cape Regional Hospital over 2 months in 2011. The sensitivity and specificity of radiographers' fracture detection were compared with that of a consultant radiologist. Differences were evaluated using the McNemar chi-squared test, with p<0.05 regarded as significant.<br />RESULTS: A total of 369 radiographs were analysed. The overall accuracy of reporting by radiographers was 93.7%, with 74.4% sensitivity for fracture detection. Experienced radiographers performed better than inexperienced radiographers; adult fractures were more consistently identified than paediatric fractures, and appendicular fractures were better visualised than axial fractures. In all instances there was a significant difference between fracture detection by radiographers and the radiologist. Experienced radiographers evaluating appendicular fractures in adults achieved the highest sensitivity (89.9%), which was not significantly different from that of a consultant radiologist (p=0.88).<br />CONCLUSION: The performance of experienced radiographers in our study is comparable with that of experienced radiographers internationally, who have no specific training in trauma radiograph reporting.

"1352","How many testers are needed to assure the usability of medical devices?","Expert review of medical devices","Before releasing a product, manufacturers have to follow a regulatory framework and meet standards, producing reliable evidence that the device presents low levels of risk in use. There is, though, a gap between the needs of the manufacturers to conduct usability testing while managing their costs, and the requirements of authorities for representative evaluation data. A key issue here is the number of users that should complete this evaluation to provide confidence in a product's safety. This paper reviews the US FDA's indication that a sample composed of 15 participants per major group (or a minimum of 25 users) should be enough to identify 90-97% of the usability problems and argues that a more nuanced approach to determining sample size (which would also fit well with the FDA's own concerns) would be beneficial. The paper will show that there is no a priori cohort size that can guarantee a reliable assessment, a point stressed by the FDA in the appendices to its guidance, but that manufacturers can terminate the assessment when appropriate by using a specific approach - illustrated in this paper through a case study - called the 'Grounded Procedure'.","25033757","2014","9"

Traditionally laparoscopic appendectomy requires the use of three ports. However, surgical techniques with fewer ports have been reported.<br />AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of laparoscopic appendectomy in children according to the proposed 3-step protocol using one, two or three ports.<br />MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 100 children with the diagnosis of acute appendicitis underwent laparoscopic appendectomy. Patients were treated according to the following protocol: transumbilical access with one 10 mm port using the laparoscope with working channel. The appendix was mobilized and delivered through the umbilical port and tied extracorporeally and removed. If the appendix was placed retrocecally or had adhesions, a second port was introduced. The appendix was mobilized and finally retrieved from the abdominal cavity through the camera port, and resected extracorporeally. In the cases of very short and gangrenous appendix and immobile colon, a third port was introduced and totally intra-abdominal appendectomy was performed. Patients were evaluated regarding the duration of the operation, and operative and postoperative complications.<br />RESULTS: During the study period 100 children (58 males, 42 females) had laparoscopic appendectomy: 48 children by one-port technique (group I), 27 children by two-port technique (group II) and 25 children by three-port technique (group III). The mean operative time was 33 min (20-55 min) in group I, 39 min in group II (23-60 min), and 49 min (30-75 min) in group III. There were no intraoperative complications. Wound infections were recorded in 4 (8.3%) patients in group I, three (11.1%) in group II and four (16.0%) in group III. One patient in group III developed an abdominal abscess managed conservatively.<br />CONCLUSIONS: One-port laparoscopic appendectomy is a feasible technique in children. It allows 48% of children to have the operation. The addition of a second port allows one to mobilize the appendix and perform extracorporeal resection in an additional 27% of cases. These approaches have shorter operative time compared to 3-port technique. Laparoscopic extracorporeal appendectomy, especially one-port, is found to be cost effective and have excellent cosmetic results.","24130637","2013","9"

Pyelorenal backflow has already been described in humans with retrograde pyelography. Our report presents a rare case of pyelolyphatic backflow demonstrated by a computed tomography.<br />CASE REPORT: A 67-year-old man with a history of bladder carcinoma was admitted to the emergency department due to right-sided flank pain and hematuria. Hematuria resolved after insertion of a 3-way urinary catheter, but flank pain persisted. As a result, an abdominopelvic CT was performed. CT revealed numerous tiny, serpiginous tubular structures connected with each other and filled with urine. They began intrarenally and extended caudally surrounding the ureter in the retroperitoneum. Subsequently, the patient underwent an ultrasound-guided nephrostomy to decompress the collecting system of the right kidney. Antegrade pyelography revealed minimal hydroneprosis. However, no leakage from the ureter to the retroperitoneum was observed, proving that the changes demonstrated by a CT were due to pyelolymphatic reflux caused by increased pressure in the collecting tubules filling the lymphatics with opaque urine.<br />CONCLUSIONS: This report presents a very rare case of pyelolymphatic reflux demonstrated by a CT. We present this case report as a reminder that although rare, pyelolymphatic reflux can occur as a result of obstruction without manifestations of hydronephrosis and it can be confused with leakage from the ureter.","24478814","2014",\N

Outcome measures were white blood cell (WBC) count at postoperative first day, time to soft diet, complication rate, surgical site infection (SSI) rate, length of hospital stay, and readmission within 30 days.<br />RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 478 patients underwent appendectomies, and 145 patients were excluded, leaving 333 who met inclusion criteria. Based on the time from arrival at hospital to incision, they were divided into two groups: 177 (53.2%) in group A and 156 (46.8%) in group B. There were no significant differences in preoperative demographics and clinical data between two groups. The mean WBC count at postoperative first day of group B were lower than that of group A (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0039).

OB/GYN was consulted again intraoperatively and noted a right ectopic pregnancy. The surgical intervention was completed with a right salpingectomy.<br />CONCLUSION: In a pregnant patient with right lower-quadrant pain, the differential diagnosis includes ectopic pregnancy, acute appendicitis, or in rare cases, both.","23993940","2013","11"

It is a rare disease commonly associated with acute appendicitis and it has a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Doppler ultrasound and computed tomography scan are the methods of choice to confirm diagnosis. The most frequent long-term complication in these patients is portal vein cavernoma, with subsequent portal hypertension. An early diagnosis, timely antibiotic therapy and removal of infection are essential therapeutic measures to diminish mortality. The need for anticoagulation therapy in children remains controversial. We report on a child with acute abdomen and sepsis with a diagnosis of pylephlebitis secondary to appendiceal inflammation. The patient received long-term antibiotic therapy and subcutaneous anticoagulation. Deferred appendectomy was performed with favorably outcome.","24955918","2014","8"

The underlying clinical and pathological picture is that of acute peritonitis. These abdominal signs are often so striking that they mimic an acute abdominal calamity suggesting several possible gastrointestinal, gynecologic or urologic diagnoses. Diagnosis of acute abdomen in pregnancy also remains one of the most challenging conditions as the physiological consequence of pregnancy and nonspecific laboratory parameters. A limited number of studies addressed FMF in pregnancy and none of them mentioned the diagnostic challenging of FMF during pregnancy because the patients had al been diagnosed previously.

The objective of this study is to establish the association between the previous use of antimicrobials and the development of neutropenic colitis (NC).<br />METHODS:: A case-control study was carried out with subjects diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia from 2004 to July 2013. They were identified by cross-referencing the databases from the computing area and the records from the pediatric hematology section. Cases were children with neutropenia and fever, abdominal distension and pain, diarrhea or constipation, and ultrasonography or computed tomography showing an intestinal wall thickness of â‰¥4 mm. Controls were children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia with neutropenia and fever, with or without gastrointestinal symptomatology but without images of NC.<br />RESULTS:: Thirty-eight cases and 75 controls were included; The factors associated to the development of NC were severe neutropenia (odds ratio [OR], 12.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3-51; P=0.00001), the use of antimicrobials for >10 days, within the month previous to the appearance of NC (OR, 12.4; 95% CI, 3-51; P=0.00001) and use of doxorubicin (OR, 5.43, 95% CI, 2.1-13.8, P=0.00004). In particular, the risk of developing CN was 3.46 (95% CI, 0.88-14; P=0.04) when ceftriaxone was used.<br />CONCLUSIONS:: The use of antimicrobials during >10 days before the administration of chemotherapy is a risk factor for developing NC, along with other factors previously studied.","25089604","2014","8"
"1361","Using exome data to identify malignant hyperthermia susceptibility mutations.","Anesthesiology","BACKGROUND: Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) is a life-threatening, inherited disorder of muscle calcium metabolism, triggered by anesthetics and depolarizing muscle relaxants. An unselected cohort was screened for MHS mutations using exome sequencing. The aim of this study was to pilot a strategy for the RYR1 and CACNA1S genes.<br />METHODS: Exome sequencing was performed on 870 volunteers not ascertained for MHS. Variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S were annotated using an algorithm that filtered results based on mutation type, frequency, and information in mutation databases. Variants were scored on a six-point pathogenicity scale. Medical histories and pedigrees were reviewed for malignant hyperthermia and related disorders.<br />RESULTS: The authors identified 70 RYR1 and 53 CACNA1S variants among 870 exomes. Sixty-three RYR1 and 41 CACNA1S variants passed the quality and frequency metrics but the authors excluded synonymous variants. In RYR1, the authors identified 65 missense mutations, one nonsense, two that affected splicing, and one non-frameshift indel. In CACNA1S, 48 missense, one frameshift deletion, one splicing, and one non-frameshift indel were identified. RYR1 variants predicted to be pathogenic for MHS were found in three participants without medical or family histories of MHS. Numerous variants, previously described as pathogenic in mutation databases, were reclassified by the authors as being of unknown pathogenicity.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Exome sequencing can identify asymptomatic patients at risk for MHS, although the interpretation of exome variants can be challenging. The use of exome sequencing in unselected cohorts is an important tool to understand the prevalence and penetrance of MHS, a critical challenge for the field.","24195946","2013","11"

These infections are mainly caused by eating contaminated food products, most often improperly prepared poultry meat. Campylobacteriosis usually takes the form of gastroenteritis, or inflammation of the intestines, and the characteristic symptoms are watery-mucous diarrhea often with the presence of blood in stool, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and fever.The epidemiological data suggest that in Europe, as well as in North America, bacteria of the genus Campylobacter, especially C. jejuni and C. coli, are the most commonly isolated pathogens in infections of the gastrointestinal tract in humans. Epidemiological data indicate that these organisms are a much more common cause of acute diarrhea, mostly in young children, than Salmonella and Yersinia. The lack of specific symptoms makes the diagnosis of campylobacteriosis necessary to carry out specialized microbiological diagnostics. Because so far these studies are performed in our country only in a few laboratories, the overwhelming number of cases of campylobacteriosis are not recorded in Polish epidemiological statistics. The purpose of this paper is to discuss issues related to the microbiological diagnosis of infections caused by C. jejuni and C. coli.

"1364","Comparison of Stapling Techniques and Management of the Mesoappendix in Laparoscopic Appendectomy.","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques","Many techniques for laparoscopic appendectomy have been proposed with few comparative studies. We performed a retrospective review of all patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis from 2006 to 2011. Techniques were: (1) transection of the mesoappendix and appendix with a single staple line (SSL); (2) transection of the mesoappendix and appendix with multiple staple lines (MSL); and (3) transection of the mesoappendix with ultrasonic shears and the appendix with a single staple line (USSL). A total of 565 cases were reviewed (149 SSL, 259 MSL, and 157 USSL). Patients treated with the SSL technique had decreased operative duration (P<0.001) and length of stay (P=0.003) despite equivalent disease presentations. Multivariate analysis demonstrated decreased operative duration with the SSL technique (P=0.001). Use of a SSL for transection of the mesoappendix and appendix is both a safe and efficient technique that results in reduced operative duration with excellent surgical outcomes.","24752160","2014","4"

Primary outcomes were the number of patients with AA confirmed by histology and the number of patients undergoing surgical intervention. Secondary outcomes were missed diagnoses, false positive AA and complication rate. Effect sizes were calculated using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed effects model.<br />RESULTS: Previously published papers mostly analyzed surrogate end-points such as physician's confidence about the diagnosis or the alteration of clinical signs, subjective parameters dependent on personal perception. Our article focused on clinical outcome and specifically investigated those potentially related to AA instead of unspecified abdominal pain. Opiate administration did not have an impact on the number of histologically proven AA (OR = 1.196 [0.875-1.635]; P = 0.261). Differences in appendectomy rates were only slightly above the threshold for statistical significance (OR = 1.350 [0.966-1.887]; P = 0.079), suggesting that analgesia might influence the treatment approach. On the other hand missed diagnoses (OR = 0.509 [0.087-2.990]; P = 0.455) and false positive AA (OR = 1.071 [0.596-1.923]; P = 0.818) ascertained by histologic examination were unaffected, so diagnostic accuracy was retained. Safety was not compromised by opiates, as the difference in complication rates did not reach statistical significance (OR = 0.615 [0.217-1.748]; P = 0.372).<br />CONCLUSION: Early analgesia with opiates in suspected AA might influence the approach to treatment, but does not appear to alter diagnostic accuracy or surgical outcome. To support our findings, further trials on larger sample sizes from different age groups and both genders are needed.","23973418","2013",\N

Clinical examination confirmed localised peritonism in the right iliac fossa. A tentative diagnosis of acute appendicitis was considered but in view of age a CT scan was performed. An area of abnormality in the right iliac fossa region was noted. At laparoscopy a macroscopically normal appendix and caecum was found. A smooth non-indentable mass in the lateral right iliac fossa contained loops of distal ileum, passing through a retro-caecal mesenteric defect consistent with a paraceacal hernia, with entrapment of the right ovary and fallopian tube. A right salpingectomy as performed and subsequent histopathological examination confirmed infarction of the fallopian tube.<br />DISCUSSION: Internal abdominal hernias are reported to have a post mortem incidence ranging between 0.2 and 0.9% of which only 10-15% are accounted for by pericaecal hernias. Types of pericaecal hernias include: ileocolic, retrocaecal, ileocaecal and paracaecal. These hernias are predisposed by the embryological development of the caecum retracting to the posterior abdominal wall and forming potential fossae.<br />CONCLUSION: This case highlights the need to consider a pericaecal hernia as a differential cause of right iliac fossa peritonism, and an indication for radiological imaging such as CT scan when the history is atypical for acute appendicitis.","24246293","2013",\N
"1367","[Tranverse colon volvulus].","Acta gastroenterologica Latinoamericana","The volvulus of the colon is a relatively common cause of colonic obstruction, mainly in the sigmoid colon, less frequent in the caecum, and rarely in the transverse colon. Multidetector tomography (MDCT) is able to establish the diagnosis showing dilated loops of proximal right and transverse colon, which depend on the time scale of evolution, with an abrupt transition site at the splenic flexure and a secondary torsion of the transverse colon mesentery. Volvulus of the transverse requires surgical detorsion in adults. Among the therapeutic options, simple detorsion or detorsion associated with a colopexy are included, but both have high rates of recurrence compared to resection techniques. Surgical resection of the involved segment is required prior to gangrene and perforation. Resection with or without primary anastomosis is the treatment of choice and prevents recurrence. The transverse colon volvulus is a disease of very low frequency and clinical diagnosis may be difficult. The management remains controversial. We stress that although many surgeons will never see a case of transverse colon volvulus, it should be considered as a differential diagnosis of intermittent abdominal pain or acute intestinal obstruction.","24516956","2013","12"
"1368","Switching dynamics and linear response spectra of a driven one-dimensional nonlinear lattice containing an intrinsic localized mode.","Physical review. E, Statistical, nonlinear, and soft matter physics","An intrinsic localized mode (ILM) represents a localized vibrational excitation in a nonlinear lattice. Such a mode will stay in resonance as the driver frequency is changed adiabatically until a bifurcation point is reached, at which point the ILM switches and disappears. The dynamics behind switching in such a many body system is examined here through experimental measurements and numerical simulations. Linear response spectra of a driven micromechanical array containing an ILM were measured in the frequency region between two fundamentally different kinds of bifurcation points that separate the large amplitude ILM state from the two low amplitude vibrational states. Just as a natural frequency can be associated with a driven harmonic oscillator, a similar natural frequency has been found for a driven ILM via the beat frequency between it and a weak, tunable probe. This finding has been confirmed using numerical simulations. The behavior of this nonlinear natural frequency plays important but different roles as the two bifurcation points are approached. At the upper transition its frequency coalesces with the driver and the resulting bifurcation is very similar to the saddle-node bifurcation of a single driven Duffing oscillator, which is treated in an Appendix. The lower transition occurs when the four-wave mixing partner of the natural frequency of the ILM intersects the topmost extended band mode of the same symmetry. The properties of linear local modes associated with the driven ILM are also identified experimentally for the first time and numerically but play no role in these transitions.","23410417","2013","1"

The dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome, which is associated with a reported mortality of 9.9%, develops in about 0.5 to 3.6% of persons treated with the drug. Currently, no tests are available to predict the risk of the dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome.<br />METHODS: We performed a genomewide association study involving 872 participants who had received dapsone as part of multidrug therapy for leprosy (39 participants with the dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome and 833 controls), using log-additive tests of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and imputed HLA molecules. For a replication analysis, we genotyped 24 SNPs in an additional 31 participants with the dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome and 1089 controls and performed next-generation sequencing for HLA-B and HLA-C typing at four-digit resolution in an independent series of 37 participants with the dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome and 201 controls.<br />RESULTS: Genomewide association analysis showed that SNP rs2844573, located between the HLA-B and MICA loci, was significantly associated with the dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome among patients with leprosy (odds ratio, 6.18; P=3.84Ã—10(-13)).

Aim of our study is to evaluate the statistical relation between anatomic, anesthesiological and surgical variables in the case of PH, DG or impaired voice register.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: 50 patients (30 thyroidectomies, 8 videolaparoscopic cholecistectomies, 2 right emicolectomies, 2 left emicolectomies, 1 gastrectomy, 1 hemorrhoidectomy, 1 nefrectomy, 1 diagnostic videothoracoscopy, 1 superior right lung lobectomy, 1 appendicectomy, 1 incisional hernia repair, 1 low anterior rectal resection, 1 radical hysterectomy) underwent clinical evaluation and direct laryngoscopy before surgery, within 6 hours, after 72 hours and after 30 days, to evaluate motility and breathing space, phonatory motility, true and false vocal folds and arytenoids oedema. We evaluated also mean age (56.6 Â± 3.6 years), male:female ratio (1:1.5), cigarette smoke (20%), atopic comorbidity (17/50 = 34%), Mallampati class (32% 1, 38% 2, 26% 3, 2% 4), mean duration of intubation (159 minutes, range 50 - 405 minutes), Cormack-Lehane score (34% 1, 22% 2, 22% 3, 2% 4), difficult intubation in 9 cases (18%). No complication during the laryngoscopy were registered. We investigated the statistic relationship between pre and intraoperative variables and laryngeal symptoms and lesions.<br />RESULTS: In our experience, statistically significant relations were found in prevalence of vocal folds oedema in smokers (p < 0.005), self limiting DG and DN in younger patients (p < 0.005) and in thyroidectomy (p < 0.01), DG after thyroidectomy (p < 0.01). The short preoperative use of steroids and antihistaminic to prevent allergic reactions appears not related to reduction or prevention of DN, DG, PH and ST. No statistical relation in incidence of postoperative complications was found for the prolonged intubation, gastro-esophageal reflux, BURP manoeuvre (backward upward right sided pressure) and Mallampati and Cormack-Lehane class more than 2, maintenance with sevoflurane 2% and use of stilet.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Direct laryngoscopy is essential for the detection of arytenoid lesions after orotracheal intubation for general anesthesia. In our opinion, a part of temporary post-operative DN or PH is due to monolateral or bilateral arytenoids oedema, secondary to prolonged or difficult orotracheal intubation, valuable with laryngoscopy 72 hours after surgery. Is necessary to adjunct these complications in the surgical informed consensus scheme.","23918003",\N,\N

Here, we present two consanguineous families with missense (c.157T>C, p.(C53R)) or nonsense (c.657G>A, p.(W219*)) mutations in BMPR1B. Homozygous affected individuals show clinical and radiographic findings consistent with ACD-type Grebe. Functional analysis of the missense mutation C53R revealed that the mutated receptor was partially located at the cell membrane. In contrast to the wild-type receptor, C53R mutation hindered the activation of the receptor by its ligand GDF5, as shown by reporter gene assay. Further, overexpression of the C53R mutation in an in vitro chondrogenesis assay showed no effect on cell differentiation, indicating a loss of function. The nonsense mutation (c.657G>A, p.(W219*)) introduces a premature stop codon, which is predicted to be subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, causing reduced protein translation of the mutant allele. A loss-of-function effect of both mutations causing recessive ACD-type Grebe is further supported by the mild brachydactyly or even non-penetrance of these mutations observed in the heterozygous parents. In contrast, dominant-negative BMPR1B mutations described previously are associated with autosomal-dominant brachydactyly-type A2.","24129431","2014","6"

"1378","Skeletal site-specific effects of whole body vibration in mature rats: from deleterious to beneficial frequency-dependent effects.","Bone","Whole body vibration (WBV) is receiving increasing interest as an anti-osteoporotic prevention strategy. In this context, selective effects of different frequency and acceleration magnitude modalities on musculoskeletal responses need to be better defined. Our aim was to investigate the bone effects of different vibration frequencies at constant g level. Vertical WBV was delivered at 0.7 g (peak acceleration) and 8, 52 or 90 Hz sinusoidal vibration to mature male rats 10 min daily for 5 days/week for 4 weeks. Peak accelerations measured by skin or bone-mounted accelerometers at L2 vertebral and tibia crest levels revealed similar values between adjacent skin and bone sites. Local accelerations were greater at 8 Hz compared with 52 and 90 Hz and were greater in vertebra than tibia for all the frequencies tested. At 52 Hz, bone responses were mainly seen in L2 vertebral body and were characterized by trabecular reorganization and stimulated mineral apposition rate (MAR) without any bone volume alteration. At 90 Hz, axial and appendicular skeletons were affected as were the cortical and trabecular compartments. Cortical thickness increased in femur diaphysis (17%) along with decreased porosity; trabecular bone volume increased at distal femur metaphysis (23%) and even more at L2 vertebral body (32%), along with decreased SMI and increased trabecular connectivity. Trabecular thickness increased at the tibia proximal metaphysis. Bone cellular activities indicated a greater bone formation rate, which was more pronounced at vertebra (300%) than at long bone (33%). Active bone resorption surfaces were unaffected. At 8 Hz, however, hyperosteoidosis with reduced MAR along with increased resorption surfaces occurred in the tibia; hyperosteoidosis and trend towards decreased MAR was also seen in L2 vertebra. Trabecular bone mineral density was decreased at femur and tibia. Thus the most favorable regimen is 90 Hz, while deleterious effects were seen at 8 Hz. We concluded that the skeleton is frequency-scalable, thus highlighting the importance of WBV regimen conditions and suggesting that cautions are required for frequencies less than 10 Hz, at least in rats.","23545229","2013","7"

"1380","Lessons learned with laparoscopic management of complicated grades of acute appendicitis.","Journal of clinical medicine research","BACKGROUND: Laparoscopy has not been consolidated as the approach of first choice in the management of complicated appendicitis. Methodological flaws and absence of disease stratification criteria have been implicated in that less evidence. The objective is to study the safe and effectiveness of laparoscopy in the management of complicated appendicitis according to laparoscopic grading system.<br />METHOD: From January 2008 to January 2011, 154 consecutive patients who underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy for complicated appendicitis were evaluated in the prospective way. The patient's age ranged from 12 to 75 years old (31.7 Â± 13.3) and 58.3% were male. Complicated appendicitis refers to gangrenous and/or perforated appendix and were graded as 3A (segmental necrosis), 3B (base necrosis), 4A (abscess), 4B (regional peritonitis) and 5 (diffuse peritonitis). The outcomes including operative time, infection complication, operative complications and conversion rate were chosen to evaluate the procedure.<br />RESULTS: The grade 3A was the most frequent with 50 (32.4%) patients. The mean operative time was 69.4 Â± 26.3 minutes. The grade 4A showed the highest mean operative time (80.1 Â± 26.7 minutes). The wound and intra-abdominal infection rates were 2.6 and 4.6%, respectively. The base necrosis was the most important factor associated with the conversion (5.2%). The grades 4A and 5 were associated with greater possibility of intra-abdominal collection. There were no operative complications.<br />CONCLUSION: The laparoscopic management of all complicated grades of acute appendicitis is safe and effective and should be the procedure of first choice. The laparoscopic grading system allows us to assess patients in the same disease stage.","24883151","2014","8"

We used logistic regression to compare the risk of complications and 30-day mortality between LA and OA, adjusting for gender, age, severity of appendicitis, time of surgery, and calendar year. Analyses were stratified for severity of appendicitis and time period.<br />RESULTS: We included 18,426 patients. From 1998 to 2007 the use of LA rose from 12% to 61%, while the risk of surgically-treated complications fell from 5.7% to 3.2%, the risk of intra-abdominal infections fell from 2.4% to 1.1% and 30-day mortality fell from 0.30% to 0.23%. LA was associated with a lower risk of surgically-treated complications (adjusted odds ratio for LA vs. OA=0.70 (95% CI, 0.57-0.85), intraabdominal infections (OR=0.74 [95% CI, 0.55-0.99]) and mortality (OR=0.48 [95% CI, 0.18-1.30]). LA was safer than OA for simple and complicated appendicitis throughout the study period.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Risk of complications and 30-day mortality decreased in Denmark between 1998 and 2007 concurrently with implementation of LA.

Sodium lactate and potassium lactate inhibit toxigenic growth of Clostridium botulinum, and inhibition of C. perfringens has been reported. In this study, a cocktail of spores of three C. perfringens strains (ATCC 13124, ATCC 12915, and ATCC 12916) were inoculated into 100-g samples of ground skinless, boneless turkey breast formulated to represent deli-style turkey breast. Three treatment groups were supplemented with 0 (control), 1, or 2% potassium lactate (pure basis), cooked to 71 Â°C, and assayed for C. perfringens growth during 10 or 12 h of linear cooling to 4 Â°C. In control samples, populations of C. perfringens increased 3.8 to 4.7 log CFU/g during the two chilling protocols. The 1% potassium lactate treatment supported only a 2.5- to 2.7-log increase, and the 2% potassium lactate treatment limited growth to a 0.56- to 0.70-log increase. When compared with the control, 2% potassium lactate retarded growth by 2.65 and 4.21 log CFU/g for the 10- and 12-h cooling protocols, respectively. These results confirm that the addition of 2% potassium lactate inhibits growth of C. perfringens and that potassium lactate can be used as an alternative to sodium nitrite for safe extended cooling of uncured meats.","24215704","2013","11"

All patients and clinicians were unaware of the dose of warfarin during the first 4 weeks of therapy. The primary outcome was the percentage of time that the international normalized ratio (INR) was in the therapeutic range from day 4 or 5 through day 28 of therapy.<br />RESULTS: At 4 weeks, the mean percentage of time in the therapeutic range was 45.2% in the genotype-guided group and 45.4% in the clinically guided group (adjusted mean difference, [genotype-guided group minus clinically guided group], -0.2; 95% confidence interval, -3.4 to 3.1; P=0.91). There also was no significant between-group difference among patients with a predicted dose difference between the two algorithms of 1 mg per day or more. There was, however, a significant interaction between dosing strategy and race (P=0.003). Among black patients, the mean percentage of time in the therapeutic range was less in the genotype-guided group than in the clinically guided group. The rates of the combined outcome of any INR of 4 or more, major bleeding, or thromboembolism did not differ significantly according to dosing strategy.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Genotype-guided dosing of warfarin did not improve anticoagulation control during the first 4 weeks of therapy.

Due to high risk of complications in transplant patients, we usually tend to treat such patients more conservatively rather compared to the more aggressive attitude in diagnosis and surgery of non-transplant patients. Delayed diagnosis, delayed surgery, and high morbidity and mortality are more common in transplant patients with GI disease. While appendicitis is one of the most common surgical diseases, with an estimated lifetime risk of 8.6% for males and 6.7% for females, there are relatively few reports of appendicitis in solid organ transplant recipients, and the condition has rarely been reported after liver transplantation.<br />CASE REPORT: We have performed surgery on 2 cases of presumed acute appendicitis among 75 cases of kidney and liver transplantation in our series in the last 10 years. Laparoscopic technique was used for exploration of presumed acute appendicitis with atypical clinical and image presentation in a deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT) and a deceased donor kidney transplantation (DDKT).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Acute appendicitis in both patients was highly suspected preoperatively in computed tomography, and early exploration with laparoscopic technique prompted early diagnosis and treatment, with excellent surgical outcomes.","24852138","2014",\N

Although idiopathic omental infarction is uncommon, the incidence of its detection has become more frequent as a result of advances in radiological technologies. We reported on a 21-year-old man who presented with sudden onset of intermittent right lower quadrant abdominal pain for seven days. The pain became more localized at the right iliac fossa (RIF) at day 2 before admission. A physical examination revealed a fever (38.2Â°C), severe RIF tenderness, mass-like fullness, and positive rebound tenderness. A CT of the abdomen showed inflammatory changes and increased fat density mass in the right upper quadrant measuring 5 Ã— 4â€‰cm representing focal panniculitis. However, the appendix was visualized normally and the findings were not in favor of acute appendicitis. Diagnosis was carried on laparoscopically. Serosanguinous free fluid was found in all abdominal quadrants. A 6 Ã— 4â€‰cm gangrenous omental mass was noted. The omental mass was excised and an appendectomy was performed. In summary, omental infarction should be considered as a deferential diagnosis for acute right-sided abdominal pain, especially if the clinical finding does not correspond to appendicitis.","24062963","2013",\N

The aim of our study was to evaluate the feasibility and the additional contribution of three-dimensional (3D) TEE in the evaluation of AAPs in descending thoracic aorta. We studied 82 patients referred for TEE regardless of the indication. All patients underwent two-dimensional (2D) conventional acquisitions. A 3D TEE study was performed for all AAPs localized in the descending thoracic aorta. Thickness, degree of calcification, the presence of ulceration or mobile debris were compared for 2D and 3D modes. From 3D data, three types of AAPs were defined according to their morphological characteristics (surface and contours). Among 192 AAPs found on 2D acquisition, 189 (98.4 %) were also identified by 3D TEE. For AAP characterization, agreement was good between 2D TEE and 2D extracted from 3D with the multiplanar reconstruction mode: 83.6 % (k = 0.69) for thickness and 82.5 % (k = 0.72) for degree of calcification. All AAPs ulcerations (n = 13) and mobile debris (n = 3) seen in 2D were identified in 3D. 2D characteristics of the 3D AAPs' morphological types were different: type I plaques were thin and rarely calcified; type III plaques were thicker and often calcified; and type II presented intermediate characteristics. There was overlap among groups and the 3D morphology could not be predicted from 2D data. 3D TEE is a feasible method for the analysis of AAPs. In addition to conventional characterization, 3D TEE provides a new morphological approach to AAPs.","25056253","2014","12"

Although we did not find definite evidence of free air on the computed tomography (CT) scan, the patient's clinical condition suggested diffuse peritonitis requiring surgical intervention. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a thickened gastric wall with suppurative intraperitoneal fluid in which Streptococcus pyogenes grew. There was no evidence of gastric or duodenal perforation. No further operation was performed at that time. The patient was conservatively treated with antibiotics and proton pump inhibitor, and her condition improved. However, she experienced abdominal and flank pain again on postoperative day 10. CT and esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a large gastric ulcer with perforation. Unfortunately, although the CT showed further improvement in the thickening of the stomach and the mucosal defect, the patient's condition did not recover until a week later, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy taken on postoperative day 30 showed suspected gastric submucosal dissection.

Among adults its usual causes are congenital anomalies of intestinal rotation, postsurgical iatrogenic, trauma or infection diseases.<br />PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report the case of a 63-year-old woman with history of chronic constipation. The patient was hospitalized for two days with acute abdominal pain, abdominal distension and inability to eliminate flatus. The X-ray and abdominal computerized tomography scan (CT scan) showed signs of intestinal obstruction. Exploratory laparotomy performed revealed a trans-mesenteric hernia containing part of the transverse colon. The intestine was viable and resection was not necessary. Only the hernia was repaired.<br />DISCUSSION: Internal trans-mesenteric hernia constitutes a rare type of internal abdominal hernia, corresponding from 0.2 to 0.9% of bowel obstructions. This type carries a high risk of strangulation and even small hernias can be fatal. This complication is specially related to trans-mesenteric hernias as it tends to volvulize. Unfortunately, the clinical diagnosis is rather difficult.<br />CONCLUSION: Trans-mesenteric internal abdominal hernia may be asymptomatic for many years because of its nonspecific symptoms. The role of imaging test is relevant but still does not avoid the necessity of exploratory surgery when clinical features are uncertain.","24880799","2014",\N

In March 2011, a 62-year-old woman presented at our emergency department with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. On hospital day 2, she experienced chest pain. An electrocardiogram and cardiac enzyme levels suggested an acute myocardial infarction. She underwent cardiac angiography and was found to have severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction involving the mid and apical segments, which resulted in a left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.10 to 0.15 in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. Her hospital course was complicated by cardiogenic shock that required hemodynamic support with an intra-aortic balloon pump and dobutamine. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed akinesis of the mid-to-distal segments of the left ventricle and mid-to-apical dyskinesis of the right ventricular free wall characteristic of biventricular takotsubo cardiomyopathy. After several days of medical management, the patient was discharged from the hospital in stable condition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review of the literature on biventricular takotsubo cardiomyopathy that compares its hemodynamic instability and medical management requirements with those of isolated left ventricular takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

Under the provisional diagnosis of sigmoid colon perforation, a laparoscopic sigmoidectomy was performed. Although the tumor mass was undetectable during the preoperative examination, a spindle cell lesion with a diffuse longitudinal growth pattern replacing the muscularis propria was revealed by microscopic examination. The spindle cell lesion was exposed at the perforation, suggesting a causal relationship between the lesion and the perforation. The spindle cell lesion was KIT-positive and had a mutation in the C-KIT gene at exon 11. We diagnosed it as diffuse infiltrating GIST. We consider that the lesion would be a cause of the colonic perforation, and emphasize the importance of accurate diagnosis of the lesion by histological, immunohistochemical and genetic examinations.","24471968","2014","1"

We used a novel computerized decision support system to gather data from multiple general pediatrics offices. We asked families whether their child received cow's milk before 1 year of age, had a low-iron diet, or used low-iron formula. Then, at subsequent visits, we performed a modified developmental assessment using the Denver II. We assessed the effect of early cow's milk or a low-iron diet on the later failure of achieving developmental milestones. We controlled for covariates using logistic regression. Early cow's milk introduction (odds ratio (OR) 1.30, pâ€‰=â€‰0.012), as well as a low-iron diet or low-iron formula (OR 1.42, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), was associated with increased rates of milestone failure. Only personal-social milestones (OR 1.44, pâ€‰=â€‰0.002) showed a significantly higher rate of milestone failure.

During each episode, the patient developed severe abdominal pain and expelled a fleshy mass from her rectum. The fleshy mass was histopathologically diagnosed as a lipoma comprising fat cells, fibers, and blood vessels. Upon expulsion, the pain disappeared and the intussusception was immediately resolved. Colonoscopic examination revealed a 2.5-cm diameter ulcerated lesion near the ileocecal valve, which was confirmed to be inflammation by pathological examination. A subsequent barium series revealed a normal colonic tract, and the patient remained completely symptom-free for 4Â months after the incident. According to the relevant literature and our clinical experience, the treatment method for a lipoma depends on the patient's clinical manifestations and the size of the tumor. However, the various diagnostic and therapeutic modalities currently available continue to be debated; whether an asymptomatic lipoma requires treatment is controversial.

After admission the patient's condition deteriorated; acute renal failure and respiratory insufficiency developed. After 4 weeks of intensive care he was discharged to a rehabilitation facility via normal ward. At that time pancreatic sonography showed a walled-off necrosis. 7 weeks later colicky abdominal pain occurred again. Altough there were no signs of infection, suction-irrigation drainage was administered. This led to a secondary infection of the necrotic cavity, and 20 sessions of endoscopic necrosectomy were performed for 3 month. Then the patient was discharged to follow-up treatment in a stable condition.<br />CONCLUSION: Even in supposedly \"usual\" acute pancreatitis complications can lead to a prolonged course.

We introduced a bundle of pain management interventions including local anesthetic infiltration at the incision site, intravenous (IV) opioids by patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), and scheduled doses of IV ketorolac and oral acetaminophen/hydrocodone.<br />OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of these pain management interventions on pain control after laparoscopic appendectomy.<br />METHODS: We retrospectively studied pain in 206 children above 7Â years of age undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy from December 2011 to February 2012 at our institution.Â We extracted data on patient demographics, duration of anesthesia and surgery, intraoperative opioids, local anesthetic infiltration, surgical procedure reports, along with pain scores, postoperative PCA use, and opioid-related complications and hospital stays. Patients were divided into two groups - simple appendicitis without peritonitis and appendicitis with generalized peritonitis.<br />RESULTS: The incidence of substantial pain when the multimodal regimen was used was 12%, which is significantly lower than earlier reports (Fisher's exact test PÂ <Â 0.001). Patients with generalized peritonitis experienced more pain, consumed more opioids, had more unmet PCA demands, and a higher incidence of respiratory depression compared with those with simple appendicitis.<br />CONCLUSION: The multimodal regimen of local anesthetic infiltration, opioid by PCA, NSAIDs, and oral acetaminophen/hydrocodone reduced the incidence of substantial pain. Additional studies are required to identify subgroups of patients with minimal opioid requirements who can benefit from modifications of this regimen.","24112856","2013","12"
"1403","Exploring the role of muscle mass, obesity, and age in the relationship between muscle quality and physical function.","Journal of the American Medical Directors Association","BACKGROUND: Divergent conclusions emerge from the literature regarding the relationship between muscle quality (defined as muscle strength per unit of muscle mass) and physical function. These contrasted results may be due to the influence of factors such as age, obesity, and muscle mass itself. Consequently, the aim of the present study was to explore the role of these factors in the relationship between muscle quality (MQ) and physical function.<br />METHODS: Data are from 312 individuals (97 men and 215 women) aged 50 years and older. Body composition (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) and knee extension strength of the right leg (1 repetition maximum) were assessed. Appendicular lean body mass index (AppLBMI) and MQ (knee extension strength /right leg lean mass) were calculated. A composite score of physical function was created based on the timed up-and-go, alternate step, sit-to-stand, and balance tests.<br />RESULTS: MQ was significantly associated with physical function when AppLBMI (Î² = 0.179; P = .004) and body mass index (BMI) (Î² = 0.178; P = .003), but not age (Î² = 0.065; P = .26), were included in regression analysis. AppLBMI (Î² = 0.221; P < .001), BMI (Î² = 0.234; P < .001), and age (Î² = 0.134; P = .018) significantly interacted with MQ to determine physical function.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that muscle mass, obesity, and age influence the relationship between MQ and physical function, suggesting that these factors should be taken into account when interpreting MQ. Even so, higher levels of MQ were associated with higher physical function scores. Nutritional and physical activity interventions may be designed in this regard.","24566449","2014","4"
"1404","An investigation of the diversity of strains of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli isolated from cases associated with a large multi-pathogen foodborne outbreak in the UK.","PloS one","Following a large outbreak of foodborne gastrointestinal (GI) disease, a multiplex PCR approach was used retrospectively to investigate faecal specimens from 88 of the 413 reported cases. Gene targets from a range of bacterial GI pathogens were detected, including Salmonella species, Shigella species and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, with the majority (75%) of faecal specimens being PCR positive for aggR associated with the Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) group. The 20 isolates of EAEC recovered from the outbreak specimens exhibited a range of serotypes, the most frequent being O104:H4 and O131:H27. None of the EAEC isolates had the Shiga toxin (stx) genes. Multilocus sequence typing and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis of the core genome confirmed the diverse phylogeny of the strains. The analysis also revealed a close phylogenetic relationship between the EAEC O104:H4 strains in this outbreak and the strain of E. coli O104:H4 associated with a large outbreak of haemolytic ureamic syndrome in Germany in 2011. Further analysis of the EAEC plasmids, encoding the key enteroaggregative virulence genes, showed diversity with respect to FIB/FII type, gene content and genomic architecture. Known EAEC virulence genes, such as aggR, aat and aap, were present in all but one of the strains. A variety of fimbrial genes were observed, including genes encoding all five known fimbrial types, AAF/1 to AAF/V. The AAI operon was present in its entirety in 15 of the EAEC strains, absent in three and present, but incomplete, in two isolates. EAEC is known to be a diverse pathotype and this study demonstrates that a high level of diversity in strains recovered from cases associated with a single outbreak. Although the EAEC in this study did not carry the stx genes, this outbreak provides further evidence of the pathogenic potential of the EAEC O104:H4 serotype.","24844597","2014",\N

The control group received only clinical training during surgical residentship, whereas the interval group received clinical training in combination with simulation training. The registrars were allowed to do deliberate practice. The Centre for Surgical Technologies Preclinical Training Programme (CST PTP) group received a preclinical simulation course during the final year as medical students, but was not exposed to any extra simulation training during surgical residentship. At the beginning of surgical residentship and 6 months later, all subjects performed a standardized suturing task and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a POP Trainer. All procedures were recorded together with time and motion tracking parameters. All videos were scored by a blinded observer using global rating scales.<br />RESULTS: At baseline the 3 groups were comparable. At 6 months, for suturing, the CST PTP group was better than both the other groups with respect to time, checklist, and amount of movements. The interval group was better than the control group on only the time and checklist score. For the cholecystectomy evaluation, there was a statistical difference between the CST PTP study group and both other groups on all evaluation scales in favor of the CST PTP group.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Structured, preclinical proficiency-based training is better than clinical training combined with laboratory training or clinical training alone.","24016370",\N,\N

Its concomitance with isolated dissection of the superior mesenteric artery (SMAD) has not yet been reported in the literature.<br />CASE REPORT: A previously well 56-year-old man was referred to our hospital with acute-onset pain throughout the entire abdomen. A ruptured aneurysm of the middle colic artery and isolated SMAD were revealed using a computed tomography (CT) scan. Coil embolization was successfully performed for a ruptured aneurysm of the middle colic artery. During the immediate postprocedural period, the patient had ischemic colitis, but he recovered in a few days with conservative treatment. Close observation was elected to address the SMAD because the condition was not thought to be responsible for any symptoms. The CT scan followed after 2 years showed no change in SMAD.<br />CONCLUSIONS: We successfully performed endovascular treatment for a ruptured aneurysm of the middle colic artery. For the incidentally detected SMAD, close observational management was chosen.","24407510","2014","5"
"1408","Confusing untypical intestinal Behcet's disease: Skip ulcers with severe lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage.","World journal of gastrointestinal endoscopy","Behcet's disease (BD) is a rare and life-long disorder characterized by inflammation of blood vessels throughout the body. BD was originally described in 1937 as a syndrome involving oral and genital ulceration in addition to ocular inflammation. Intestinal BD refers to colonic ulcerative lesions documented by objective measures in patients with BD. Many studies have shown that over 40% of BD patients have gastrointestinal complaints. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, anorexia and abdominal distension. Although gastrointestinal symptoms are common, the demonstration of gastrointestinal ulcers is rare. This so-called intestinal BD accounts for approximately 1% of cases. There is no specific test for BD, and the diagnosis is based on clinical criteria. The manifestations of intestinal BD are similar to those of other colitis conditions such as Crohn's disease or intestinal tuberculosis, thus, it is challenging for gastroenterologists to accurately diagnose intestinal BD in patients with ileo-colonic ulcers. However, giant ulcers distributed in the esophagus and ileocecal junction with gastrointestinal hemorrhage are rare in intestinal BD. Here, we present a case of untypical intestinal BD. The patient had recurrent aphthous ulceration of the oral mucosa, and esophageal and ileo-colonic ulceration, but no typical extra-intestinal symptoms. During examination, the patient had massive acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient underwent ileostomy after an emergency right hemicolectomy and partial ileectomy, and was subsequently diagnosed with incomplete-type intestinal BD by pathology. The literature on the evaluation and management of this condition is reviewed.","24527178","2014","1"
"1409","Laparoscopy in the acute abdomen.","Best practice & research. Clinical gastroenterology","Laparoscopy has become a routine procedure in the management of acute abdominal disease and can be considered both an excellent therapeutic and additional diagnostic tool in selected cases. However, a high level of expertise in laparoscopic and emergency surgery is required. Hemodynamic instability, huge abdominal distension, fecal peritonitis and perforated cancer are relative contraindications for the laparoscopic approach. In recent years, abdominal emergencies have increasingly been managed successfully by laparoscopy. In acute appendicitis, acute cholecystitis and perforated peptic ulcer, randomized controlled trials have proven that the laparoscopic approach is as safe and as effective as open surgery, with fewer complications and a quicker postoperative recovery. Other indications such as blunt and penetrating trauma to the abdomen, small bowel occlusion and perforated diverticular disease are under debate, indicating that more randomized controlled trials comparing laparoscopic and open surgery are still necessary.","24485251","2014","2"

Appendix references of related papers were taken as supplementary indices. According to requirement for Cochrane systematic evaluation, randomized clinical trials on assessing the effectiveness and safety of Chinese herbs as main or adjuvant treatment in treating HBV-related hepatic failure were methodologically assessed, data extracted and analyzed.<br />RESULTS: Totally 21 trials on Chinese herbal medicine therapy versus standard medical therapy (involving 1 881 patients) were included. Most trials had unclear risk bias. In 5 studies on the mortality, 3 trials showed that the mortality was lower in the test group than in the control group [RR 0.40, 95% CI (0.20, 0.79), P = 0.0002]. In 6 randomized control trials, totally 20 papers reported the control of complications. Eight results showed Chinese herbal medicine therapy had better effect in controlling complications. The recurrence rate and assessment of the survival quality were reported. Considering secondary indicators, four trials showed Chinese herbal medicine therapy had better effect in lowering the ineffective rate, decreasing total bilirubin (TBIL), and elevating prothrombin activity (PTA). Other prescriptive analyses found that the overall effect on secondary indicators was better in the test group than in the control group, but not all the indicators were statistically different.

"1411","Nonrotation of intestine: a case report.","Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR","Nonrotation of intestine is a congenital abnormality of the midgut which is due to error in the process of rotation. Errors in the 2nd and 3rd stage of rotation can lead to series of abnormalities in the form of malrotation and reversed rotation. As a consequence, the relative position of other organs likes caecum, intestine, meckel's diverticulum changes. This can lead to missing diagnosis of common clinical conditions such as appendicitis. The incidence of nonrotation is 1:500. The congenital abnormality appears to be rare as this could be an incidental abnormality. The symptoms of nonrotation of intestine could be biliary vomiting, recurrent abdominal pain. This could be due to midgut volvulus and intestinal obstruction which happens as a consequence of nonrotation of the intestine. The investigations used for detection and confirmation are CT Imaging. Other associations of nonrotation of the intestine are peritoneal bands. Here we report a case of nonrotation of intestines. In the cadaver of age around 70 years, the small intestinal loops was situated in the right side of the abdominal cavity and large intestine looped on the left side of the abdominal cavity. This was also associated with aberrant position of the caecum and appendix. There were associated peritoneal bands extending from the ascending colon to the left side the abdominal wall. The bands had been removed to visualize the large intestinal loops.","24392405","2013","11"

Forty-one equine veterinarians randomly assigned into three groups were each presented a different set of 28 moving picture films randomly chosen among 36 films of horses with colic and four controls. One randomly chosen film was embedded twice within each set. The first (n=15) and the second (n=16) groups scored pain with the EAAPS-1 and EAPPS-2, respectively, while the third (n=10) used the NRS. The intra-class correlations (ICC) for EAAPS-1 (0.80) and EAAPS-2 (0.76) vs. NRS (0.67) indicated superior inter-rater reliability for both EAPPS scales. The intra-rater reliability of the EAAPS-1 was superior to both the other scales (weighted Îº=0.9) vs. 0.5 and 0.7 for EAAPS-2 and NRS, respectively). The convergent validity between both EAAPS scores and the NRS scores was substantial (weighted Îº=0.64). Both EAAPS scales discriminated well between extreme groups (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve, ROC, area under the curve, AUC, >0.9) to differentiate severe from mild pain, as judged by the NRS.

It is characterized by recurrent episodes of angioedema, which commonly affects the skin (in the form of swelling in the extremities, face and genitals) as well as the gastrointestinal tract (abdominal pain attacks). In approximately 1% of cases of angiodema-related swelling, there is obstruction of the upper airway, which is potentially life-threatening. Therefore, HAE due to C1 inhibitor deficiency may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Recent research has added to our ever-increasing understanding of the pathogenesis of HAE, which has, in addition, new clinical trials with new therapeutic agents and strategies. The following editorial covers drugs currently under investigation that have the potential to be promising new therapeutic options. While some compounds show promise for the future, there are currently no oral treatments available for the treatment of acute attacks. Furthermore, some of the intravenous therapies currently available require numerous injections and do not always prevent acute attacks. Attenuated androgens also may have problematic side effects, highlighting the need for new treatment options.","24797354","2014","7"

Because patients with acute cerebral infarction often cannot complain of abdominal pain due to loss of consciousness, hemiparesis and aphasia, delays in diagnosis may increase the severity of the condition. It is clearly important to identify symptoms, reach a diagnosis and provide treatment as soon as possible. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical features of AC after acute cerebral infarction.<br />METHODS: Among the 1,682 patients with acute cerebral infarction admitted to our hospital between April 2007 and July 2012, AC after acute cerebral infarction was diagnosed in 24 (1.4%). Data regarding age, sex, past history, fasting period, period from admission to the onset of cholecystitis, clinical type, severity of cholecystitis, diffusion-weighted imaging Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at onset and modified Rankin scale at 90 days were investigated.<br />RESULTS: The mean age of the 24 patients (15 men, 9 women) was 74.2Â±11.9 years (range, 45-90 years). The clinical type was atherothrombosis in five patients, lacunar infarction in seven patients, cardiac embolism in 10 patients and dissection in two patients. The past history included atrial fibrillation in 10 (42%) patients, hypertension in 20 (83%) patients and diabetes in 11 (46%) patients. The mean duration of fasting was 10.7 days (range, 1-32 days). The mean interval between the onset of cholecystitis and admission was 8.3 days (range, 0-24 days). The median NIHSS score at onset of cerebral infarction was 10, and 23 (96%) patients were bedridden at the onset of cholecystitis.<br />CONCLUSION: AC after acute cerebral infarction was frequently observed in the patients with severe hemiparesis and those who were fasted. It is important to identify symptoms, accurately diagnose the condition and provide treatment as soon as possible in order to achieve early ambulation and resumption of food intake using a feeding tube.","24930651","2014",\N

A retrospective review comparing single-incision laparoscopic (SILS) appendectomy and traditional multiport laparoscopic (MP) appendectomy was conducted to assess the safety and feasibility of the less invasive laparoscopic technique.<br />METHODS: All SILS and MP appendectomies performed by three surgeons at a single institution during 43Â months were reviewed. Statistical evaluation included descriptive analysis of demographic data including age and gender, as well as bi- and multi-variate analyses of operative outcomes including operative time, conversions, complications, and hospital length of stay.<br />RESULTS: The study reviewed 168 patients who underwent SILS appendectomy and 108 patients who underwent MP appendectomy. No statistically significant difference was found between the mean SILS and MP operative times (43.63 vs. 40.95Â min; pÂ =Â 0.29). Additionally, no statistically significant association was noted between surgical approach and length of hospital stay. Although 0.93Â % of MP appendectomies and 2.38Â % of SILS appendectomies were converted to open procedure, this difference was not statistically significant (pÂ =Â 0.65, Fisher's exact test). After exclusion of cases converted to open procedure from the study, the findings showed that 3.66Â % of SILS cases were converted to multiport laparoscopy. No increase in the overall complication rate was associated with SILS compared with MP appendectomy. The wound complications documented included one incisional hernia for SILS appendectomy and two wound infections for MP appendectomy.<br />CONCLUSION: The findings showed SILS appendectomy to be a safe and feasible alternative to traditional MP appendectomy that can be conducted with operative times, lengths of stay, and complication rates similar to those of the standardized technique. This review is a precursor to prospective studies, which are warranted to demonstrate conclusively the equivalence of operative times, complications, and lengths of hospital stay, as well as to elucidate differences in patient-centered outcomes including postoperative pain, cosmesis, and quality of life.","24091553","2014","2"

The effect of thoracic chemoperfusion in combination with HIPEC in these patients is unknown.<br />METHODS: A prospective database of 1,077 procedures was analyzed. Type of malignancy, thoracic perfusion, resection status, comorbidities, morbidity, mortality, and overall survival were reviewed.<br />RESULTS: DR was a component of 102 CRS/HIPEC procedures performed for 57 (55.9 %) appendiceal and 22 (21.6 %) colon primary lesions. DR was associated with higher volume of disease as evidenced by more organ resections (3.7 vs. 2.8, p < 0.001) and increased rates of incomplete cytoreduction (67 vs. 52 %, p = 0.004). Patients with and without DR had similar 30-day major morbidity (23.5 vs. 16.8 %, p = 0.1) and worse 90-day mortality (12.8 % vs. 6.12 %, p = 0.03), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed DR (p = 0.01) and diabetes (p = 0.005) to be associated with worse mortality. Nineteen (20 %) DR patients underwent synchronous abdominal and thoracic chemoperfusion. Intrathoracic recurrence following DR with thoracic perfusion was 17 % (3/18) vs. 2.3 % (2/85) without perfusion (p = 0.04). Median survival following complete cytoreduction was similar for patients with low-grade appendiceal (LGA) (not reached with DR and 175 months without DR, p = 0.17) and colorectal cancer (23 months with and 31 months without DR, p = 0.76).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Diaphragmatic resection during CRS/HIPEC is an independent predictor of surgical mortality. Intrapleural perfusion was associated with more thoracic recurrence; however, complete cytoreduction with or without DR can achieve similar survival for patients with LGA and colorectal primary lesions. DR should be performed only if careful inspection deems all peritoneal disease resectable.","25034815","2014","12"

Using a computer simulation of the progression of HIV infection and data from the HIV Prevention Trials Network 052 study, we projected the cost-effectiveness of early ART for such persons.<br />METHODS: For HIV-infected partners in serodiscordant couples in South Africa and India, we compared the early initiation of ART with delayed ART. Five-year and lifetime outcomes included cumulative HIV transmissions, life-years, costs, and cost-effectiveness. We classified early ART as very cost-effective if its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was less than the annual per capita gross domestic product (GDP; $8,100 in South Africa and $1,500 in India), as cost-effective if the ratio was less than three times the GDP, and as cost-saving if it resulted in a decrease in total costs and an increase in life-years, as compared with delayed ART.<br />RESULTS: In South Africa, early ART prevented opportunistic diseases and was cost-saving over a 5-year period; over a lifetime, it was very cost-effective ($590 per life-year saved). In India, early ART was cost-effective ($1,800 per life-year saved) over a 5-year period and very cost-effective ($530 per life-year saved) over a lifetime. In both countries, early ART prevented HIV transmission over short periods, but longer survival attenuated this effect; the main driver of life-years saved was a clinical benefit for treated patients. Early ART remained very cost-effective over a lifetime under most modeled assumptions in the two countries.<br />CONCLUSIONS: In South Africa, early ART was cost-saving over a 5-year period. In both South Africa and India, early ART was projected to be very cost-effective over a lifetime. With individual, public health, and economic benefits, there is a compelling case for early ART for serodiscordant couples in resource-limited settings.

"1426","A case of acute pancreatitis following endoscopic biopsy of the ampulla of Vater.","The Kurume medical journal","Ampullary tumors are diagnosed by endoscopic biopsy of the ampulla of Vater. We encountered a rare case of acute pancreatitis following endoscopic biopsy of the ampulla. A 53-year-old man referred to our hospital for detailed examination of a suspected tumor of the ampulla of Vater. We conducted endoscopic biopsy from the ampulla. He developed severe abdominal pain four hours after the procedure. The serum amylase and serum lipase were elevated and abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed pancreatic enlargement and diffuse stranding of the peri-pancreatic fat, compatible with the findings of acute pancreatitis. We diagnosed the patient as having acute pancreatitis caused by endoscopic biopsy of the ampulla of Vater. Conservative therapy improved his condition, however, a large pancreatic walled-off necrosis (WON) developed. Therefore, we performed endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)-guided cyst drainage on the 74th day after admission. The WON diminished gradually in size and the symptoms disappeared, and the patient was discharged in good physical condition on the 137th day after admission. In this case, the ampullary biopsy may have caused mucosal edema or intraductal hematoma, resulting in pancreatic duct obstruction. It is important for endoscopists both to be aware of this potential complication following endoscopic biopsy of the ampulla and to inform the patients about possible complications of this procedure.","24464133","2013",\N

The macroscopic and histopathological lesions of the elbow joints of 30 adult cats were evaluated immediately after euthanasia. Macroscopic evidence of degenerative joint disease was found in 22 of 30 cats (39 elbow joints) (73.33% cats; 65% elbow joints), and macroscopic cartilage erosion ranged from mild fibrillation to complete ulceration of the hyaline cartilage with exposure of the subchondral bone. Distribution of the lesions in the cartilage indicated the presence of medial compartment joint disease (most severe lesions located in the medial coronoid process of the ulna and medial humeral epicondyle). Synovitis scores were mild overall and correlated only weakly with macroscopic cartilage damage. Intra-articular osteochondral fragments either free or attached to the synovium were found in 10 joints. Macroscopic or histologic evidence of a fragmented coronoid process was not found even in those cases with intra-articular osteochondral fragments. Lesions observed in these animals are most consistent with synovial osteochondromatosis secondary to degenerative joint disease. The pathogenesis for the medial compartmentalization of these lesions has not been established, but a fragmented medial coronoid process or osteochondritis dissecans does not appear to play a role.","24476939","2014","9"
"1429","Is 18F-FDG PET/CT more reliable than 99mTc-MDP planar bone scintigraphy in detecting bone metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma?","Annals of nuclear medicine","OBJECTIVE: Bone metastasis occurs frequently in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical value of 18F-FDG PET/CT with that of 99mTc-MDP planar bone scintigraphy (PBS) for detecting bone metastasis in NPC patients.<br />METHODS: Thirty-five histologically proven NPC patients were enrolled in this retrospective study. They underwent both 18F-FDG PET/CT and PBS within 7 days in our department. In a lesion-based analysis, the skeletal system, excluding the head, was divided into four regions: the spine, the pelvis, the thorax, and the appendix. Bone metastasis was considered to be present by either biopsy or clinical follow-up for at least 6 months. PET/CT and PBS were compared by McNemar's paired-sample test.<br />RESULTS: A total of 50 lesions were confirmed to be malignant (spine 27, thorax 11, pelvis 8 and appendix 4). Although PET/CT was found to be more sensitive on lesion level than PBS (sensitivity 70.0 versus 42.0%; P=0.044), there were still 14 metastatic (28.0%) lesions that could be detected by PBS while negative in PET/CT imaging. In a patient-based analysis, fifteen (42.9%) of 35 eligible patients were found to have bone metastasis. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of PET/CT was 60.0% (9/15), 100% (20/20) and 82.9% (29/35); as for PBS, it was 66.7% (10/15), 85.0% (17/20) and 77.1% (27/35), respectively. There was no statistical difference between PET/CT and PBS (P>0.05).<br />CONCLUSIONS: PBS, as a conventional imaging, should be used as an important complement for detecting bone metastasis in NPC patients.","24610681","2014","6"

Correct diagnosis and appropriate surgical intervention can often pose a challenge.<br />PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 12-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with a four day history of initially central acute abdominal pain, now localised in the RIF. During laparoscopy, the following findings were made: macroscopically dilated appendix, right and left gonads at the internal opening of the inguinal canal, empty pelvis with a rudimentary uterus on the right side. No evidence of fallopian tubes or connection of uterus to the vagina and broad based, non-inflamed Meckel's diverticulum. An incidental diagnosis of complete androgen insensitivity syndrome was made.<br />DISCUSSION: Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a disorder of hormone resistance characterised by a female phenotype in an individual with an XY karyotype and testes producing age-appropriate normal concentrations of androgens.<br />CONCLUSION: This case report highlights the advantage of laparoscopy as a diagnostic and treatment tool in a twelve year old girl with multiple intra-abdominal findings. While the ultimate diagnosis responsible for her symptom of RIF pain was acute appendicitis, the additional diagnosis of CAIS and incidental Meckel's would have otherwise likely gone undetected.","24995665","2014",\N
"1431","Divergence in skeletal mass and bone morphology in antarctic notothenioid fishes.","Journal of morphology","Although notothenioid fishes lack swim bladders, some species live temporarily or permanently in the water column. Given its relatively high density, skeletal mass is a key determinant of buoyancy. Notothenioids have reduced skeletal ossification, but there is little quantitative data on the phylogenetic distribution of this trait. We obtained dry skeletal masses for 54 specimens representing 20 species from six notothenioid families. Although comparative data are sparse, notothenioid skeletons comprise a smaller percentage of body mass, <3.5%, than those of three non-notothenioid perciforms. With relatively high skeletal mass, the non-Antarctic Bovichtus diacanthus is similar in skeletal mass to some non-notothenioids. Eleginops maclovinus, the non-Antarctic sister group of the Antarctic clade, has a relatively light skeleton (<2% of body mass) similar to many species in the Antarctic clade. Low skeletal mass is therefore a synapomorphy shared by Eleginops plus the Antarctic clade. We provide gross, histological, and micro-CT documentation of the structure and location of bone and cartilage in skulls, pectoral girdles, and vertebrae, with emphasis on the bovichtid B. diacanthus, the eleginopsid E. maclovinus, and the channichthyid Chaenodraco wilsoni. In Eleginops and the Antarctic clade, most bone is spongy and most species have persisting cartilage in the skull and appendicular skeleton. We also measured the relative size of the notochordal canal in adult vertebral centra of 38 species representing all eight families. There is considerable interspecific variation in this pedomorphic trait and all species show an ontogenetic reduction in the relative size of the canal. However, large persisting canals are present in adults of the Antarctic clade, especially in the nototheniids Pleuragramma and Aethotaxis and in a number of bathydraconid and channichthyid genera.","24590921","2014","8"

Transmural migration of an intra-abdominal gossypiboma has been reported to occur in the digestive tract, bladder, vagina and diaphragm. Open surgery is the most common approach in the treatment of gossypiboma. However, gossypibomas can be extracted by endoscopy while migrating into the digestive tract. We report a case of intractable duodenal ulcer caused by transmural migration of gossypiboma successfully treated by duodenorrhaphy. A systemic literature review is provided and a scheme of the therapeutic approach is proposed.<br />CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old Han Chinese man presented with intermittent epigastric pain for the last 10 months. He had undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy conversion to open cholecystectomy for acute gangrenous cholecystitis 10 months ago at another hospital. Transmural migration of gossypiboma into the duodenum was found. Endoscopic intervention failed to remove the entire gauze, and duodenal ulcer caused by the gauze persisted. Surgical intervention was performed and the gauze was removed successfully. The penetrated ulcer was repaired with duodenorrhaphy. The postoperative period was uneventful.We systematically reviewed the literature on transmural migration of gossypiboma into duodenum and present an overview of published cases. Our PubMed search yielded seven reports of transmural migration of retained surgical sponge into the duodenum. Surgical interventions were necessary in two patients.<br />CONCLUSION: Transmural migration of gossypiboma into the duodenum is a rare surgical complication. The treatment strategies include endoscopic extraction and surgical intervention. Prompt surgical intervention should be considered for emergent conditions such as active bleeding, gastrointestinal obstruction, or intra-abdominal sepsis. For non-emergent conditions, surgical intervention could be considered for intractable cases in which endoscopic extraction failed.","24917191","2014",\N

Mean stricture length was 2.5 cm. Stricture formation was secondary to impacted ureteral stones in three patients and failed pyeloplasty for congenital ureteropelvic junction obstruction in the remaining three. Each patient had ipsilateral flank pain prior to surgery.<br />RESULTS: Mean operative time, estimated blood loss and hospital stay were 244 minutes, 175 ml, and 3.2 days, respectively. No intraoperative or perioperative complications were noted. The objective success rate was 100% (all patients had radiographic and/or endoscopic resolution of their ureteral strictures). The subjective success rate was 66%, (two patients developed recurrent discomfort, which upon exploration was found to be due to fibrosis away from the appendiceal on-lay graft where the gonadal vessels crossed the ureter). Both patients with recurrent pain underwent laparoscopic ureterolysis and bladder advancement flap proximal to the appendiceal on-lay, which markedly improved one patient's pain but the other patient continued to have discomfort ultimately resulting in a laparoscopic nephroureterectomy.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Appendiceal on-lay ureteroplasty is a viable treatment option for patients with complex right proximal and mid ureteral strictures, while minimizing the potential morbidity of appendiceal and ileal interposition.","24471943","2014","1"
"1435","Prognostic factors of early metastasis and mortality in dogs with appendicular osteosarcoma after receiving surgery: an individual patient data meta-analysis.","Preventive veterinary medicine","Recently an aggregated data meta-analysis showed that serum alkaline phosphatase (SALP) and proximal humerus location are predictors for shorter survival in canine osteosarcoma. To identify additional prognostic factors of mortality and metastasis an individual patient data meta-analysis (IPDMA) was conducted. Individual patient data from 20 studies, identified via the VSSO society, were pooled. Univariable and multivariable hazard ratios (HR) for metastasis and mortality were assessed, using stratified Cox models. The study included 1405 dogs who received surgical treatment, of which the metastasis status was measured in 1155 dogs and mortality status in 1336 dogs; median survival was 256 days. High versus normal SALP and weight (kg) were associated with an increase in hazard of metastasis [HR 1.34 (95%CI 1.07; 1.68) and HR 1.02 (per kg increase) (95%CI 1.01; 1.03)] and for mortality [HR 1.43 (95%CI 1.16; 1.77) and HR 1.02 (95%CI 1.01; 1.02)]. Distal radius tumor was associated with a lower hazard of metastasis compared to other locations: HR 0.75 (95%CI 0.58; 0.96). Proximal humerus and distal femur or proximal tibia location were related with an increased mortality: HR 1.53 (95%CI 1.26; 1.84) and HR 1.23 (95%CI 1.01; 1.49) compared to other locations. Older age (years) was associated with a higher hazard for mortality [HR 1.06 per year (95%CI 1.03; 1.09)] but not for metastasis: HR 1.03 (95%CI 0.99; 1.06). These results confirm findings from a recent aggregated data meta-analysis and (in addition) showed that tumor location, SALP, weight were prognostic factors for both mortality and metastasis. Age was a prognostic factor for mortality but not for metastasis.","24054333","2013","11"

Consequently, clinicians might not always consider a diagnosis of heterotopic pregnancy. Transvaginal ultrasound or other imaging modalities cannot be completely relied upon to exclude heterotopic pregnancy from the differential diagnosis of pregnant patients with abdominal pain.<br />CASE: A 32-year-old woman, G5 P3105, presented to the emergency room with acute onset of diffuse abdominal pain. Ultrasound demonstrated an approximately 8-week intrauterine pregnancy. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy for suspected torsion of a right ovarian cyst. Repeat exploratory laparotomy was required due to symptomatic anemia. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy. Pathology results demonstrated a right tubal ectopic pregnancy.<br />CONCLUSION: Surgical and medical options exist for heterotopic pregnancy management. Despite negative heterotopic pregnancy results for transvaginal ultrasound, the possibility of heterotopic pregnancy should remain within the differential diagnosis of any pregnant patient with either natural or assisted reproduction technology intrauterine pregnancy who presents with abdominal pain and/or clinical signs of ectopic pregnancy.","24568051",\N,\N

All women with symptoms suggestive of endometriosis who were scheduled for laparoscopy underwent detailed preoperative TVS, in particularâ€‰to ascertain whether the POD was obliterated. POD obliteration was assessed using a real-time TVS technique called the 'sliding sign'. Preoperative TVS sliding sign findings were then compared to gold standard laparoscopic POD findings.<br />RESULTS: One hundred consecutive women with preoperative TVS and laparoscopic outcomes were included in the finalâ€‰analysis. Mean age was 32.8â€‰years and mean age at diagnosis of endometriosis wasâ€‰27.4â€‰years. At laparoscopy, 84/100 (84%) were found to have some form of endometriosis (73% peritoneal endometriosis, 35% ovarian endometrioma(s), 33% deep infiltrating endometriosis). At laparoscopy, 30/100 (30%)â€‰had an obliterated POD and 19/30 (63.3%) of these women also had evidence of bowel endometriosis. The sonographic sliding sign technique had an accuracy of 93.0%,â€‰sensitivity of 83.3%, specificity of 97.1%, positive predictive value of 92.6%, negative predictive value of 93.2%, positive likelihood ratio of 29.2 and negative likelihood ratio of 0.17 in the prediction of POD obliteration (Pâ€‰=â€‰1.8E-16).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative real-time dynamic TVS evaluation using the sliding sign seems to establish with a high degree of certainty whether the POD is obliterated. Given the increased risk of deep infiltrating endometriosis in women with POD obliteration, the TVS sliding sign technique may also be useful in the identification of women who may be at a higher risk for bowel endometriosis.","23001892","2013","6"

Full blood testing revealed a white cell count of 38Ã—10(9)/L and a C reactive protein (CRP) of 278â€…mg/L. A CT scan revealed a gallbladder empyema that extended into the right iliac fossa. This case highlights the potential for a hyperdistended gallbladder empyema to present as acute right iliac fossa pain with blood tests suggestive of complicated disease. Further analysis confirmed Actinomyces infection as the underlying aetiology prior to a laparoscopic subtotal cholecystectomy. This case serves to remind clinicians of this as a rare potential cause of atypical gallbladder pathology.","24872493","2014",\N

He had been evaluated extensively in the recent past undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, colonoscopy and CT scan of the abdomen with normal results. The provisional diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome was performed and pinaverium bromide was started. The patient had pre-existing hypertension, a major depressive disorder and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. He had been taking nebivolol and pantoprazole for several years and mirtazapine for the last 1 year. The patient developed nausea, vomiting and anorexia after 5 days of starting pinaverium bromide. Investigations revealed marked elevation of liver enzymes and bilirubin. He was negative for HIV, HBSAg, anti-hepatitis C virus, IgM for hepatitis A virus, hepatitis E virus, antinuclear antibody and antimitochondrial antibody. An ultrasound showed mild hepatomegaly with hypoechoic echo texture; the rest of scan was normal. Pinaverium and mirtazapine were stopped immediately.

This study aims to demonstrate the difference, if any, in the demographics, work-up, management and complication rate of patients in these two groups.<br />METHODS: This was a retrospective review of all patients who underwent laparoscopic appendicectomy at a major public hospital and major private hospital over the same 13 months. Data included demographics, admission details, work-up, length of stay, time to surgery, histology and complications. Fisher's exact test and the unpaired t-test were performed to look at the statistical difference between these two groups.<br />RESULTS: Total laparoscopic appendicectomies were 164 (public) and 105 (private). Median waiting times to operation were 13 and 9.5â€‰h, respectively. Histological findings of appendicitis/neoplasia/normal appendix were 83.5/3.0/13.4% and 81.9/1.9/16.2%. Histological findings of gangrene or perforation were 26.2% and 11.6% (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0081). The proportion of those who had surgery more than 24â€‰h after admission was 12.2% and 4.8% (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0517). Rates of pelvic collection were 1.2% and 1.9% (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.6448), wound infection rates were 2.4% and 1.9% (Pâ€‰=â€‰1) and overall complication rates were 7.3% and 8.6% (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.8165). Mean operative time was 49.79â€‰min for consultants and 67.98â€‰min for registrars (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001).<br />CONCLUSION: Consultants are faster at laparoscopic appendicectomies than registrars. A consultant lead service in a private hospital has earlier operation times and less patients ending up with gangrenous or perforated appendicitis but does not alter complication rates.","24943051","2014","6"
"1450","Superior mesenteric artery syndrome: a rare cause of intestinal obstruction. Diagnosis and surgical management.","The Indian journal of surgery","Superior mesenteric artery syndrome is a rare but well-known clinical entity characterized by compression of the third or transverse portion of the duodenum against the aorta by the superior mesenteric artery, resulting in chronic, intermittent, or acute, complete or partial, duodenal obstruction. The treatment for this arteriomesenteric compression includes conservative measures and surgical intervention. The aim of the study was to evaluate our surgical management and outcomes of the patients with superior mesenteric artery syndrome. The cases with superior mesenteric artery syndrome admitted between January 2000 and January 2010 were retrospectively investigated from the patients' records. All six patients had a history of chronic abdominal pain, nausea, postprandial early satiety, vomiting, and weight loss. Diagnostic methods included barium esophagogastroduodenography, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and computed tomography. Medical management was the first step of treatment in all cases before surgery. Of those, four underwent Roux-en-Y duodenojejunostomy and two underwent gastroenterostomy. Postoperative periods were uneventful and mean duration of hospitalization after the operations was 7Â days. Conservative initial treatment is usually followed by surgical intervention for the main problem that is the narrowing of the aortomesenteric angle in patients with superior mesenteric artery syndrome. This syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with chronic upper abdominal pain. Duodenojejunostomy is the most frequently used procedure with a high success rate.","24426403","2013","4"

Secondary end points were physical function, patient-reported outcomes, muscle strength, body composition, and biomarkers. Analysis of covariance was used to compare outcomes for groups at 6 and 12 mo adjusted for baseline values.<br />RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Participants undergoing supervised exercise showed improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness performance at 6 mo (-19 s [p=0.029]) and 12 mo (-13 s [p=0.028]) and better lower-body physical function across the 12-mo period (p<0.01). Supervised exercise also improved self-reported physical functioning at 6 (p=.006) and 12 mo (p=0.002), appendicular skeletal muscle at 6 mo (p=0.019), and objective measures of muscle strength at 6 and 12 mo (p<0.050). Limitations included the restricted number of participants undertaking body composition assessment, no blinding to group assignment for physical functioning measures, and inclusion of well-functioning individuals.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Supervised exercise training in long-term PCa survivors is more effective than physical activity educational material for increasing cardiorespiratory fitness, physical function, muscle strength, and self-reported physical functioning at 6 mo. Importantly, these benefits were maintained in the long term with a home-based programme with follow-up at 12 mo.<br />CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY: The effect of an exercise intervention on cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors in prostate cancer patients from the RADAR study, ACTRN: ACTRN12609000729224.","24113319","2014","5"

The present study was conducted to determine whether the minimal access approach by laparoscopy was equally feasible as the open method.<br />AIM: To compare laparoscopic vs. open management duodenal perforation in all aspects.<br />MATERIAL AND METHODS:<br />INCLUSION CRITERIA: patients presenting to the emergency ward with acute pain in the abdomen with clinical signs of peritonitis and air under the diaphragm on X-ray abdomen standing were selected. Exclusion criteria were: patient age < 15 years and > 70 years, presentation > 2 days, shock with systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg which did not improve after hydration with 2000 ml of Ringer lactate solution, respiratory distress, history of cardiac disorder or respiratory disorders such as ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, bleeding and clotting disorders, pregnancy in females, previous upper abdominal surgery, and intra-operatively patients having perforation other than duodenal perforation. After excluding patients fitting the above criteria, two groups - test and control - were formed.<br />RESULTS: We found that complications both early and late were significantly fewer in patients treated by laparoscopy. Thus laparoscopy was both feasible and had comparable mortality and leakage rate.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic management of perforated duodenal ulcer is feasible, effective and decreases morbidity and overall treatment time and cost if performed in properly selected patients.","24868276","2013",\N

The transvaginal route is now the only one that can be used for NOTES procedures in daily clinical practice. We performed hybrid NOTES appendectomy that was preevaluated and approved by the Japan NOTES and Institutional Review Board. A 5-mm trocar was inserted transumbilically and used for laparoscope access. An additional transumbilical 2.3-mm port was placed, through which the surgeon inserted a grasper. We created a transvaginal port with a long 12-mm trocar. Laparoscopic instruments such as a vessel sealing system, surgical staplers, and a retrieval bag were introduced, and the surgical technique consequently became safer, although the access route was limited. The appendix was removed transvaginally. The patient did not need epidural anesthesia or any pain medication. The cosmetic results were better than that of conventional single-port surgery. Triangulation is achieved in this procedure, which makes the surgery easier. To generalize NOTES to many types of surgery and enable it to be performed in men, the transgastric approach is essential. The development of flexible instruments designed for NOTES is also necessary.","24358726","2013","11"
"1454","Management of Spigelian hernia caused by necrobiotic fibroma of the uterus in a pregnant woman.","International journal of surgery case reports","INTRODUCTION: Spigelian hernias are a rare type of hernia through the Spigelian aponeurosis. Spigelian hernias are very uncommon and constitute only 0.12% of all abdominal wall hernias. These hernias are located in the aponeurosis of the internal oblique muscle and transverse abdominal muscle.<br />PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 30-year-old woman at 28 weeks' gestation was admitted to the obstetrics department due to pain and swelling in the anterior abdominal right region. On inspection, we suspected either a lipoma, a spontaneous hematoma, a tumor of the abdominal wall, or a Spigelian hernia. A Doppler USG and abdominal and pelvic Magnetic Resonance Imaging revealed necrobiotic fibroma of the uterus in Spigelian hernia. The patient was started on dual analgesic and corticotherapy. Overall, the patient improved one week after the acute episode and had no further pain during her gynecologic follow-up.<br />DISCUSSION: We have reported a first case of Spigelian hernia that was complicated by uterine fibroid. The clinical presentation varies, depending on the contents of the hernial sac and the degree of herniation. MRI is the preferred method for accurately identifying masses of the abdominal wall. Our treatment options were based on the extent of the acute-phase reaction and the venous thrombosis.<br />CONCLUSION: It is important to differentiate this rare Spigelian hernia from other hernias as the treatment for this hernia is medical rather than surgical. Before the final choice of treatment is made, digestive surgeons should bear this rare hernia in mind.","24238671","2013",\N

Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences","BACKGROUND: Low lean mass is potentially clinically important in older persons, but criteria have not been empirically validated. As part of the FNIH (Foundation for the National Institutes of Health) Sarcopenia Project, this analysis sought to identify cutpoints in lean mass by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry that discriminate the presence or absence of weakness (defined in a previous report in the series as grip strength <26kg in men and <16kg in women).<br />METHODS: In pooled cross-sectional data stratified by sex (7,582 men and 3,688 women), classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was used to derive cutpoints for appendicular lean body mass (ALM) that best discriminated the presence or absence of weakness. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to quantify the strength of the association between lean mass category and weakness.<br />RESULTS: In primary analyses, CART models identified cutpoints for low lean mass (ALM <19.75kg in men and <15.02kg in women). Sensitivity analyses using ALM divided by body mass index (BMI: ALMBMI) identified a secondary definition (ALMBMI <0.789 in men and ALMBMI <0.512 in women). As expected, after accounting for study and age, low lean mass (compared with higher lean mass) was associated with weakness by both the primary (men, odds ratio [OR]: 6.9 [95% CI: 5.4, 8.9]; women, OR: 3.6 [95% CI: 2.9, 4.3]) and secondary definitions (men, OR: 4.3 [95% CI: 3.4, 5.5]; women, OR: 2.2 [95% CI: 1.8, 2.8]).<br />CONCLUSIONS: ALM cutpoints derived from a large, diverse sample of older adults identified lean mass thresholds below which older adults had a higher likelihood of weakness.","24737559","2014","5"

Large metal bezoars are very rare with only a few case reports till date in literature. We report a case of a metal bezoar in a man with Maniac Depressive Psychosis who had a history of ingesting Nails and screws of sizes varying from 2Â cm to 15Â cm for more than 1Â year without causing any perforation and other acute complication.<br />CASE PRESENTATION: A 24-year-old man presented with a history of mild dull aching type of abdominal pain of chronic onset and no other GI symptoms. The patient had history of passing small sized nails in the stools and intermittent melena for last 1Â year. Physical examination revealed mild tenderness in Para umbilical region. Past medical history was remarkable for treatment of Maniac depressive psychosis. Plain radio graphs revealed objects of metal density contained within a dilated stomach at the level of L2-3 vertebrae in the midline. Celiotomy was performed and 27 metal nails and screws of sizes 6Â cm to 15Â cm and bent in various shapes were removed from inside the stomach. Post operatively patient recovery was normal and he was referred to psychiatrist.<br />CONCLUSION: Abdominal pain in patients with psychiatric disorders can result from rare causes such as bezoars and such bizarre metal nails without causing any acute abdominal symptoms. This report alerts surgeons to rule out bezoars in the differential diagnosis of chronic abdominal pain and melenic stools with no abdominal symptoms in patients with psychiatric health problems.","24426615","2013","6"

Clinical features and imaging studies suggested afferent loop obstruction caused by an enterolith after Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage was initially performed because of severe cholangitis with septic shock. The enterolith was located in the jejunal limb adjacent to the hepaticojejunostomy site. Cholangioscopic lithotripsy was performed through the percutaneous transhepatic route to the enterolith, and the fragments were moved into the efferent loop using scope push and saline flush methods.

The first case is a 5-year-old female who presented with flank and abdominal pain associated with low-grade fever and anorexia. She had localized tenderness in the right lower quadrant and a leukocytosis with left shift. Intraoperative findings included a normal-appearing appendix, but ex vivo examination revealed Enterobius vermicularis. The second case is a 7-year-old female who presented with periumbilical abdominal pain, anorexia, and emesis. She had tenderness at McBurney's point, and ultrasound revealed a small echogenic focus within the appendix. Intraoperatively, the distal tip of the appendix appeared inflamed. Again, ex vivo examination revealed E. vermicularis. Enterobius vermicularis infection of the appendix can present with a clinical picture similar to acute appendicitis. In at-risk populations, it should be included in the differential diagnosis for children with right lower quadrant abdominal pain.

Currently, norovirus is the most common cause of AGE in all age groups in many countries. We analysed clinical differences in reported cases of acute gastroenteritis caused by caliciviruses (AGC) by age group and agent involved. We conducted a descriptive study of AGE outbreaks reported to the Public Health Agency of Catalonia (Spain) in 2010 and 2011. The odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to estimate the association between clinical symptoms and age. Clinical differences between the <15Â years and â‰¥15Â years age groups were statistically significant: children more frequently presented with vomiting (OR, 3.25; 95% CI, 2.56-4.13), abdominal pain (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 2.60-4.12), fever (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.17-1.96) and nausea (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.19-1.85). Comparing clinical manifestations of sapovirus and norovirus infection in children aged <15Â years, cases caused by norovirus more frequently presented with vomiting and fever (pÂ <0.001), and cases caused by sapovirus more frequently presented with diarrhoea (pÂ 0.013).

"1469","Exploring high dimensional data with Butterfly: a novel classification algorithm based on discrete dynamical systems.","Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)","MOTIVATION: We introduce a novel method for visualizing high dimensional data via a discrete dynamical system. This method provides a 2D representation of the relationship between subjects according to a set of variables without geometric projections, transformed axes or principal components. The algorithm exploits a memory-type mechanism inherent in a certain class of discrete dynamical systems collectively referred to as the chaos game that are closely related to iterative function systems. The goal of the algorithm was to create a human readable representation of high dimensional patient data that was capable of detecting unrevealed subclusters of patients from within anticipated classifications. This provides a mechanism to further pursue a more personalized exploration of pathology when used with medical data. For clustering and classification protocols, the dynamical system portion of the algorithm is designed to come after some feature selection filter and before some model evaluation (e.g. clustering accuracy) protocol. In the version given here, a univariate features selection step is performed (in practice more complex feature selection methods are used), a discrete dynamical system is driven by this reduced set of variables (which results in a set of 2D cluster models), these models are evaluated for their accuracy (according to a user-defined binary classification) and finally a visual representation of the top classification models are returned. Thus, in addition to the visualization component, this methodology can be used for both supervised and unsupervised machine learning as the top performing models are returned in the protocol we describe here.<br />RESULTS: Butterfly, the algorithm we introduce and provide working code for, uses a discrete dynamical system to classify high dimensional data and provide a 2D representation of the relationship between subjects. We report results on three datasets (two in the article; one in the appendix) including a public lung cancer dataset that comes along with the included Butterfly R package. In the included R script, a univariate feature selection method is used for the dimension reduction step, but in the future we wish to use a more powerful multivariate feature reduction method based on neural networks (Kriesel, 2007).<br />AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: A script written in R (designed to run on R studio) accompanies this article that implements this algorithm and is available at http://butterflygeraci.codeplex.com/.

"1473","Cecal pneumatosis intestinalis in obstructing sigmoid cancer: emergency metallic stenting.","The American journal of emergency medicine","An 85-year-old man presented with acute abdomen. Abdominal computed tomography revealed obstructing sigmoid colon cancer with pneumatosis intestinalis of the ascending colon. A surgeon was consulted for colonic obstruction with impending sepsis, who declined surgery considering the patient's advanced age. After discussion, the patient consented for emergent endoscopic metallic colonic stent placement. Complete obstruction of the lumen was observed at the sigmoid colon, followed by successful metallic colonic stent placement through the obstructed area. Normal stool passage was achieved after this, and the patient survived the 9-month follow-up period. Acute colonic obstruction from obstructive colon cancer requires emergency management, wherein the presence of pneumatosis intestinalis poses a high risk of cecal perforation. Emergency endoscopic colonic metallic stent placement provides an alternative therapy, particularly when surgery is not feasible, as described here.","24275044","2014","4"

The WHO classification and case definitions were used to classify the disease as Dengue Fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Clinical, hematological and biochemical findings were recorded serially until discharge.<br />RESULTS: During the study period, 90 (34.75%) presented with typical features of DF, 28 (31.11%) were dengue proven, seven (7.7%) proved to be of malaria in which malarial parasites were found positive in the peripheral blood, while the remaining 55 (61.11%) patients were dengue probable. Age of the patients ranged from 13 to 76 years. Fever was the most common clinical presentation (100%) followed by vomiting 50 (55.56%), body ache 31 (34.44%) abdominal pain 17 (18.89%) and headache 9 (10%). Maculopapular rash was seen in 4(4.44%) patients. Laboratory findings included thrombocytopenia, leucopenia and raised alanine aminotransferase levels. Eighty one patients (90%) improved clinically and hematologically and were discharged in stable condition.<br />CONCLUSION: Fever and thrombocytopenia were the most common presentation of dengue fever (DF). The overall mortality of DF is low, if treated appropriately. Awareness of health care professionals and public regarding preventive strategies is essential to fight against this disease.","24353520","2013","1"

The intervention exercise and education materials were developed as an online resource, and included video demonstrations recorded in a laboratory. Resources were loaded onto a dedicated section of the University Preventive Medicine Service website. All sessions included stretching, and exercises to improve postural stability (abdominal, lumbar, hip and thigh muscles) strength, flexibility and mobility. Outcome measures were self-reported health status (visual analogue scale (VAS) of the Euroquol-5D questionnaire); functional health status (Oswestry disability questionnaire); and the stage of change questionnaire. At nineâ€‰months, outcomes in the intervention group were analysed and compared with baseline and outcomes in controls.<br />RESULTS: In the intervention group, significant positive effects were observed at nine-month follow up for stage of change in the behavioural domain as related with low back pain for all phases except for the contemplation phase.

The identification of the transcriptome of haustoria and an understanding of the functions of expressed genes therefore hold essential keys for the elucidation of fungus-plant interactions and the development of novel fungal control strategies. Here, we purified haustoria from infected leaves and used 454 sequencing to examine the haustorial transcriptomes of Phakopsora pachyrhizi and Uromyces appendiculatus, the causal agents of soybean rust and common bean rust, respectively. These pathogens cause extensive yield losses in their respective legume crop hosts. A series of analyses were used to annotate expressed sequences, including transposable elements and viruses, to predict secreted proteins from the assembled sequences and to identify families of candidate effectors. This work provides a foundation for the comparative analysis of haustorial gene expression with further insights into physiology and effector evolution.","24341524","2014","5"

PFAPA syndrome is characterized by recurrent attacks of fever and symptoms of inflammation consistent with the disease acronym. Since autoinflammatory diseases are, by definition, mediated by cells of the innate immune system, the aim of this study was to evaluate the functional features of neutrophils, the most abundant innate immune cell in the circulation, in children with PFAPA syndrome.<br />METHODS: Blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), obtained from patients with PFAPA syndrome during both febrile and asymptomatic, afebrile phases of the disease, as well as from healthy children (afebrile controls) and children with fever and abdominal pain (febrile controls), were analyzed for 3 key neutrophil characteristics: 1) apoptosis (measured by annexin V/7-aminoactinomycin D staining), 2) production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (measured by luminol/isoluminol-amplified chemiluminescence), and 3) priming status (measured as responsiveness to galectin-3 and up-regulation of CD11b).<br />RESULTS: Compared to PMNs obtained from patients with PFAPA syndrome during an afebrile interval and those from febrile controls, PMNs obtained from patients during a PFAPA syndrome flare produced elevated levels of intracellular NADPH oxidase-derived ROS, had significantly diminished rates of spontaneous apoptosis, and displayed signatures of priming. In contrast, PMNs from afebrile patients with PFAPA syndrome had a significantly elevated rate of spontaneous apoptosis compared to PMNs from afebrile controls.<br />CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that 3 key aspects of neutrophil innate immune function, namely, apoptosis, priming, and generation of an intracellular oxidative burst, are altered, most prominently during febrile attacks, in children with PFAPA syndrome.","23983059","2013","11"

In 2012, 27.0% of youth aged 12-15 had 2 hours or less of TV plus computer use daily. Among youth aged 12-15, girls (80.4%) were more likely to use the computer 2 hours or less daily when compared with boys (69.4%). Fewer non-Hispanic black youth aged 12-15 (53.4%) reported watching 2 hours or less of TV daily than non-Hispanic white (65.8%) and Hispanic (68.7%) youth. Excessive screen-time behaviors, such as using a computer and watching TV, for more than 2 hours daily have been linked with elevated blood pressure, elevated serum cholesterol, and being overweight or obese among youth (1-3). Additionally, screen-time behavior established in adolescence has been shown to track into adulthood (4).

All demographic data, clinical history, radiologic studies, indications for and type of operation, operative time and complications, and pathology were recorded.<br />RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with a mean age of 12.5 years (range 3.6-17.4 years) underwent SIL for adnexal pathology. Operative interventions included cystectomy (56%), salpingo oopherectomy (26.5%), detorsion (8.8%), adnexal biopsy (5.9%), and oophoropexy (2.9%). Forty-four percent of the patients also underwent appendectomy. The mean operative time was 42.8 minutes. There was 1 wound infection (2.9%) and 2 patients (5.9%) required additional ports.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Single incision laparoscopy provides a safe and effective approach to diagnostic laparoscopy with the ability to carry out operative interventions in multiple quadrants without adding additional ports.

The classic triad of abdominal pain, hematochezia, and palpable abdominal mass is seen in a few patients.â€¢ Early diagnosis of intussusception depends on a high level of clinical suspicion in any child with non specific abdominal findings followed by appropriate radiographic or ultrasonographic evaluation and confirmation with a contrast enema.â€¢ Abdominal radiography, although an appropriate component of the initial workup for gastrointestinal symptoms, lacks the sensitivity to reliably exclude the presence of intussusception.â€¢ Because ultrasonography is a safe, sensitive, and specific test for the diagnosis of intussusceptions, it should be performed early whenever there is clinical suspicion of intussusception.â€¢ Contrast enema is the gold standard for diagnosis and first-line treatment of intussusception.

Abdominal computerized tomography (CT) revealed a 9 cm pseudocyst containing air, and a fistular opening was observed via colonoscopy. After colonoscopy, the abdominal pain was slightly improved, the fever subsided and laboratory results showed decreased C-reactive protein levels. The observed improvement was likely due to the cleansing of the bowel, which induced spontaneous drainage from the pseudocyst into the colon.

However, fertility after laparoscopic IPAA has never been assessed.<br />METHODS: All patients who underwent a total laparoscopic IPAA between 2000 and 2011 and were aged 45 years or less at the time of operation and 18 years or more at the time of data collection were included. The patients answered a fertility questionnaire by telephone. All demographic and perioperative data were prospectively collected. The results were compared with those of controls undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy.<br />RESULTS: Sixty-three patients were included. The mean age at the time of surgery was 31 Â± 9 years (range 14-44). IPAA was performed for ulcerative colitis in 73% of the cases and familial adenomatous polyposis in 17%. The mean follow-up after IPAA was 68 Â± 33 months (range 6-136). Fifty-six patients answered the questionnaire (89%). Half of them already had a child before IPAA. Fifteen patients attempted pregnancy after IPAA, of which 11 (73%) were able to conceive, resulting in 10 ongoing pregnancies and 1 miscarriage. The global infertility rate was 27%.

These infections are mainly caused by eating contaminated food products, most often improperly prepared poultry meat. Campylobacteriosis usually takes the form of gastroenteritis, or inflammation of the intestines, and the characteristic symptoms are watery-mucous diarrhea often with the presence of blood in stool, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and fever. The epidemiological data suggest that in Europe, as well as in North America, bacteria of the genus Campylobacter, especially C. jejuni and C. coli, are the most commonly isolated pathogens in infections of the gastrointestinal tract in humans. Epidemiological data indicate that these organisms are a much more common cause of acute diarrhea, mostly in young children, than Salmonella and Yersinia. The lack of specific symptoms makes the diagnosis of campylobacteriosis necessary to carry out specialized microbiological diagnostics. Because so far these studies are performed in our country only in a few laboratories, the overwhelming number of cases of campylobacteriosis are not recorded in Polish epidemiological statistics.

Like other hernias, they may contain abdominal contents but are more likely to be incarcerated due to the small size of the fascial defect.(1) We describe here the case of a 71-year-old female with a 10-year history of right lower quadrant pain that remained undiagnosed despite multiple imaging studies. Prior to presentation the patient developed a new bulge and increasing pain at this site; an ultrasound revealed the presence of a bowel-containing hernia. The patient was taken urgently to the operating room for a laparoscopic Spigelian hernia repair, and was found to have an incarcerated appendix in the hernia. After the hernia was reduced, an appendectomy was performed and the hernia was repaired with biological mesh. Postoperatively, the patient did well, and her pain resolved.","24945840","2010",\N
"1503","Implications of Foley catheterization in children with perforated appendicitis.","The Journal of surgical research","BACKGROUND: We treat patients after appendectomy for perforated appendicitis with patient controlled analgesia (PCA) using a background continuous dose. We usually place urinary catheters in these patients because of concerns of urinary retention. The objective of the present study was to determine the rate of urinary retention in this patient population when a catheter was not used or was removed before the continuous PCA infusion was discontinued.<br />METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all patients who had received PCA postoperatively for perforated appendicitis from December 2008 to May 2011. The demographics, need for replacement of a Foley catheter, number of recorded nursing calls to physicians, and the incidence of urinary tract infection was recorded. Patients who had received a urinary catheter intraoperatively were compared with those who had not. Subgroups were also created according to whether the patients with a Foley catheter had undergone removal of their catheter before or after cessation of the continuous PCA infusion.<br />RESULTS: Of 242 patients, 20 (8.3%) did not have a catheter postoperatively, 1 of whom required a catheter because of retention. Of the 222 patients who started with a catheter, 2 required reinsertion for retention (P = 0.59). Age, gender, and body mass index were similar for patients with and without a catheter. In the subgroup analysis, of the patients with a catheter, 48 (21.6%) had their catheter removed before discontinuation of the continuous PCA infusion and none required Foley catheter replacement. Of the 174 patients whose catheters were removed after discontinuation of the continuous PCA dose, 2 required catheter replacement (P = 0.46). A significantly higher percentage of telephone calls was generated for patients with a catheter than for patients without a Foley catheter (41.4% versus 10%, P = 0.007). No patients with a catheter developed a urinary tract infection.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a perforated appendicitis who receive a continuous PCA have a low rate of urinary retention whether or not a catheter has been placed intraoperatively.","23746765","2013","9"
"1504","Treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection with fecal transplantation.","Gastroenterology nursing : the official journal of the Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates","Clostridium difficile infection is an increasingly common clinical challenge in hospitals and healthcare facilities. The infection often results in severe complications for the infected individual including relentless diarrhea, abdominal pain, dehydration, and mortality. Currently, there is a significant gap between research and practice in the management of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, and treatment guidelines are limited. Numerous attempts at treating this infection have been made including the practice of fecal transplantation. A comprehensive literature search was conducted and 6 studies were reviewed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of fecal transplantation as a modality in treating recurrent Clostridium difficile infection refractory to other treatment methodologies. The implementation of fecal transplantation is suggested to restore normal bowel flora in individuals with Clostridium difficile and rid patients of the infection. Additional studies have since revealed perceived barriers toward the implementation of this treatment modality, although it has shown promising results with success rates of 83%-100%. Further efficacy testing validation is needed in larger, prospective controlled trials to guide healthcare providers in the direction of a reliable, standardized treatment protocol for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection.","24691086",\N,\N
"1505","Impact of a randomized clinical trial on children with perforated appendicitis.","Surgery","BACKGROUND: We previously conducted a randomized, clinical trial comparing early appendectomy with interval appendectomy for perforated appendicitis. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect this clinical trial had on subsequent practice patterns and outcomes for patients with perforated appendicitis at the free-standing children's hospital conducting the trial.<br />METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted comparing children with perforated appendicitis treated before the trial (2005-2006) and after the trial (2009-2011). Early appendectomy was performed within 24 hours of diagnosis; interval appendectomy occurred 4-6 weeks after initial treatment with antibiotics. Patient characteristics, treatment variables, and outcomes were collected and compared.<br />RESULTS: The pretrial group consisted of 92 patients-62 (67%) underwent early appendectomy, and 30 (33%) patients had interval appendectomy. The posttrial group was composed of 103 patients, with 87 (84%) undergoing early appendectomy and 16 (16%) interval appendectomy (P = .005). The groups were similar in patient and admission characteristics, although the posttrial group had a lower percentage of self-pay patients and fewer computed tomography scans; health care use was similar between groups. Overall, the posttrial group had fewer adverse events (18% vs 34%, P = .02), specifically fewer wound infections (2% vs 14%, P = .001) and fewer unplanned readmissions (7% vs 16%, P = .04) than the pretrial group. In the posttrial group, those patients selected for interval appendectomy were more likely to complete the planned course of therapy than in the pretrial group.<br />CONCLUSION: A clinical trial conducted at our institution to evaluate currently available treatment options for perforated appendicitis did change practice patterns at our hospital. After the trial, there was an increase in the use of early appendectomy, a decrease in the number of computed tomography scans performed per patient, and a reduction in the overall adverse event rate.","24878457","2014","8"

Patient demographics, type of operation (classified according to disease and anatomic site), complications, and length of hospital stay (LOS) were recorded.<br />RESULTS: Out of 12,596 surgeries, 1803 (14.3%) minimally invasive procedures were performed: Soave-Georgeson endorectal colon pull-through for Hirschsprung's disease (N.=82); colectomy for chronic inflammatory bowel disease (N.=37); ileal J-pouch ano-rectal Knight-Griffen anastomosis in colectomized patients with chronic ulcerative colitis (N.=35); Nissen fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease (N.=148); cholecystectomy (N.=68); appendectomy (N.=341); laparoscopic or thoracoscopic tumor resection or biopsy (N.=90); reconstruction of the renal pelvi and ureters (N.=11); and Nuss thoracoplasty for pectus excavatum (N.=237). The median age was 3 years; the median LOS was 3 days; the complications rate was 0.9% (N.=18).<br />CONCLUSION: According to our experience, minimally invasive surgery is a safe and efficacious alternative to conventional surgery (in terms of complications) also in children. It was associated with shorter LOS and improved quality of life, with less pain and better aesthetic results. It has become the preferred surgical treatment option by parents.","24826972","2014","6"
"1507","Identification and sequence characterization of novel Theileria genotypes from the waterbuck (Kobus defassa) in a Theileria parva-endemic area in Kenya.","Veterinary parasitology","Waterbuck (Kobus defassa), an ungulate species endemic to the Eastern African savannah, is suspected of being a wildlife reservoir for tick-transmitted parasites infective to livestock. Waterbuck is infested by large numbers of Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, the tick vector for Theileria parva, and previous data suggests that the species may be a source of T. parva transmission to cattle. In the present study, a total of 86 cattle and 26 waterbuck blood samples were obtained from Marula, a site in Kenya endemic for East Coast fever (ECF) where the primary wildlife reservoir of T. parva the Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer) is also common. To investigate for the presence of cattle-infective Theileria parasites, DNA specimens extracted from the blood samples were subjected to two diagnostic assays; a nested PCR based on the p104 gene that is specific for T. parva, and a reverse line blot (RLB) incorporating 13 oligonucleotide probes including all of the Theileria spp. so far described from livestock and wildlife in Kenya. Neither assay provided evidence of T. parva or Theileria sp. (buffalo) infection in the waterbuck DNA samples. By contrast, majority of the cattle samples (67.4%) were positive for T. parva using a nested PCR assay. The RLB assay, including a generic probe for the genus Theileria, indicated that 25/26 (96%) of the waterbuck samples were positive for Theileria, while none of the 11 Theileria species-specific probes hybridized with the waterbuck-derived PCR products. Phylogenetic analysis of 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences within the RLB-positive waterbuck samples revealed the occurrence of three Theileria genotypes of unknown identity designated A, B and C. Group A clustered with Theileria equi, a pathogenic Theileria species and a causative agent of equine piroplasmosis in domestic equids. However, DNA from this group failed to hybridize with the T. equi oligonucleotide present on the RLB filter probe, suggesting the occurrence of novel taxa in these animals. This was confirmed by DNA sequencing that revealed heterogeneity between the waterbuck isolates and previously reported T. equi genotypes. Group B parasites clustered closely with Theileria luwenshuni, a highly pathogenic parasite of sheep and goats reported from China. Group C was closely related to Theileria ovis, an apparently benign parasite of sheep. Together, these findings provided no evidence that waterbuck plays a role in the transmission of T. parva. However, novel Theileria genotypes detected in this bovid species may be of veterinary importance.","24690249","2014","5"
"1508","Jejunal intussusception: a rare cause of an acute abdomen in adults.","BMJ case reports","Abdominal pain secondary to intussusception is a common presentation in the paediatric population but rare in adults. Diagnosis is often difficult due to non-specific signs and symptoms. Adult intussusception presents more insidiously with intermittent abdominal pain and signs and symptoms of an acute abdomen are rare. In children, the aetiological factor is usually idiopathic, whereas intussusception in adults is more commonly due to an underlying pathology giving rise to a lead point. Consequently the treatment of choice is different-while it is supportive in children, surgical management is typically indicated in adults. In addition, the causes of a lead point precipitating adult intussusception are different depending on whether they arise from the small or large bowel. This report presents a case of jejunal intussusception in a 30-year-old man with a characteristic CT scan who required exploratory laparotomy and small bowel resection.","24872480","2014",\N

Comorbidities, clinical findings, laboratory markers, radiographic findings, and nonsurgical treatments associated with failure of nonoperative management were recorded.<br />RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients were identified, and 69 were managed successfully to discharge without operation. Length of stay was greater in the failure group (11 days vs. 5 days, p = 0.001), and intensive care unit care was more common (10% vs. 0%, p = 0.049). On univariate and multivariate analyses, smoking (odds ratio [OR], 13.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-142; p = 0.039), tachycardia (OR, 4.93; 95% CI, 1.21-20.06; p = 0.026), and generalized abdominal tenderness (OR, 5.52; 95% CI, 1.40-21.73; p = 0.015) were associated with failure of nonoperative management.

Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences","BACKGROUND: The concept of sarcopenia has expanded recently to include muscle strength or physical performance. We investigated whether the Europe Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) definition of sarcopenia predicts the risk of all-cause mortality in community-dwelling older adults.<br />METHODS: This study included 284 men and 272 women aged 65 and older. The outcome was all-cause mortality during the 6-year follow-up period. We defined sarcopenia based on the EWGSOP definitions of sarcopenia: height (ht)- or weight (wt)-adjusted appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM/ht(2) or ASM/wt) assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, leg muscle strength, and short physical performance battery test score.<br />RESULTS: During the 6-year follow-up, 40 men and 19 women died. The risk of death was 2.99 times and 3.22 times higher in men with sarcopenia identified by ASM/ht(2) and ASM/wt, respectively, compared with nonsarcopenic men. The hazard ratio for death was 5.37 for men with weak leg muscle strength. Men with a low short physical performance battery score had a 3.15 times higher risk of death compared with those with high short physical performance battery scores, even after adjusting for all covariates. The adjusted hazard ratios for EWGSOP-defined sarcopenia were 4.00 for ASM/ht(2) and 6.89 for ASM/wt in men. By contrast, sarcopenia defined by these criteria was not associated with a higher risk of death in women.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that, in older men, EWGSOP-defined sarcopenia is related to higher mortality compared with nonsarcopenia regardless of the ASM/ht(2) or ASM/wt index. In older women, further studies with large sample sizes are needed to assess whether EWGSOP-defined sarcopenia increases the mortality risk.","24721723","2014","10"

"1513","High-level gait and balance disorders in the elderly: a midbrain disease?","Journal of neurology","The pathophysiology of gait and balance disorders in elderly people with 'higher level gait disorders' (HLGD) is poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to identify the brain networks involved in this disorder. Standardised clinical scores, biomechanical parameters of gait initiation and brain imaging data, including deep white matter lesions (DWML) and brain voxel-based morphometry analyses, were assessed in 20 HLGD patients in comparison to 20 age-matched controls. In comparison to controls, HLGD patients presented a near-normal preparatory phase of gait initiation, but a severe alteration of both locomotor and postural parameters of first-step execution, which was related to 'axial' hypokinetic-rigid signs. HLGD patients showed a significant grey matter reduction in the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) and the left primary motor cortex. This midbrain atrophy was related to the severity of clinical and neurophysiologically determined balance deficits. HLGD patients also showed a reduction in speed of gait, related to 'appendicular' hypokinetic-rigid signs and frontal-lobe-like cognitive deficits. These last two symptoms were correlated with the severity of DWML, found in 12/20 HLGD patients. In conclusion, these data suggest that the gait and balance deficits in HLGD mainly result from the lesion or dysfunction of the network linking the primary motor cortex and the MLR, brain regions known to be involved in the control of gait and balance, whereas cognitive and 'appendicular' hypokinetic-rigid signs mainly result from DWML that could be responsible for a dysfunction of the frontal cortico-basal ganglia loops.","24202784","2014","1"

The establishment of newer systemic treatments is an unmet clinical need for unresectable or relapsed peritoneal pseudomyxoma. The aim of our study was to assess the activity of chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX-4 regimen) in terms of response rate in this subset of patients.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were included in a single-center, observational study and treated with FOLFOX-4 administered every 2 weeks for up to 12 cycles or until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.<br />RESULTS: Twenty consecutive patients were reviewed from July 2011 to September 2013. Only partial responses were observed, with an objective response rate of 20%. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 8 months and 26 months, respectively. Two patients were able to undergo laparotomy with complete cytoreduction and HIPEC in one case. Safety data for FOLFOX-4 were consistent with the literature. By means of a mutant enriched polymerase chain reaction, KRAS mutation was found in 16 of 19 cases (84%), and MGMT promoter methylation was found in 8 (42%, all KRAS mutant).<br />CONCLUSION: FOLFOX-4 chemotherapy is tolerable and active in patients with peritoneal pseudomyxoma when disease is deemed unresectable or relapsed after peritonectomy and HIPEC. The identification of predictive biomarkers, such as KRAS for resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies and MGMT for response to temozolomide, is a priority for the development of evidence-based treatment strategies for peritoneal pseudomyxoma.","24951608","2014","8"
"1515","Adult cyclical vomiting syndrome: a disorder of allostatic regulation?","Experimental brain research","Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is an idiopathic illness characterized by stereotypic and sudden-onset episodes of intense retching and repetitive vomiting that are often accompanied by severe abdominal pain. Many associated factors that predict CVS attacks, such as prolonged periods of fasting, sleep deprivation, physical and emotional stress, or acute anxiety, implicate sympathetic nervous system activation as a mechanism that may contribute to CVS pathogenesis. Furthermore, adult patients with CVS tend to have a history of early adverse life events, mood disorders, chronic stress, and drug abuse-all associations that may potentiate sympathetic neural activity. In this review, we set forth a conceptual model in which CVS is viewed as a brain disorder involving maladaptive plasticity within central neural circuits important for allostatic regulation of the sympathetic nervous system. This model not only can account for the varied clinical observations that are linked with CVS, but also has implications for potential therapeutic interventions. Thus, it is likely that cognitive behavioral therapy, stress management (\"mind-body\") interventions, regular exercise, improved sleep, and avoidance of cannabis and opiate use could have positive influences on the clinical course for patients with CVS.","24736863","2014","8"

The peritoneal cancer index (1-39) was used for peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) staging. Mitomycin C (88.8%) was administered intraperitoneally at 42 Â°C for 90 mins. Risk factors associated with major morbidities were analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analyses.<br />RESULTS: The mean age was 55.1 (Â±11.3) years, and the majority (77.1%) of patients had complete cytoreduction (CC0-1). Tumor types included colorectal (nâ€‰=â€‰51, 30.0%), appendiceal (nâ€‰=â€‰50, 29.4 %), pseudomyxoma peritonei (nâ€‰=â€‰16, 9.4%), and other (nâ€‰=â€‰53, 31.2%).

Several hours later she returned with similar symptoms, and she was diagnosed with distal small bowel obstruction by computed tomography scan. During the diagnostic laparoscopy there was an internal hernia through a defect created by the appendiceal staple line and the adjacent small bowel mesentery. After reduction of the hernia, the small bowel venous drainage improved, and no intestinal resection was necessary. The offending staple was removed and the staple line covered with omentum. The patient had complete resolution of symptoms and she was discharged the following day. No perioperative complications occurred. Mechanical staplers are routinely used in laparoscopic appendectomy. The staple line should be inspected at the end of the procedure to confirm the absence of free, unformed staples that can generate adhesions and postoperative complications.","24859400","2014",\N

A 73-year-old male patient with typeÂ 2 diabetes mellitus complicated with neuropathy associated with schizophrenia was admitted to Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan, because of a high fever and general malaise. On the fourth hospital day, despite normal liver function tests and little abdominal pain, his abdominal computed tomography showed huge gas formation in the gallbladder lumen along with a dilated gallbladder with a thickened wall, consistent with emphysematous cholecystitis. The patient underwent an emergency open cholecystectomy. Few abdominal symptoms appeared because of the hyposensitivity to pain caused by not only diabetic neuropathy, but also antipsychotic agents the patient was taking for schizophrenia. Emphysematous cholecystitis should be taken into consideration for the differential diagnosis of high fever in diabetic patients with schizophrenia, irrespective of the level of liver function tests and clinical symptoms.","24843619","2012","12"
"1528","Blood pressure and incidence of twelve cardiovascular diseases: lifetime risks, healthy life-years lost, and age-specific associations in 1Â·25 million people.","Lancet","BACKGROUND: The associations of blood pressure with the different manifestations of incident cardiovascular disease in a contemporary population have not been compared. In this study, we aimed to analyse the associations of blood pressure with 12 different presentations of cardiovascular disease.<br />METHODS: We used linked electronic health records from 1997 to 2010 in the CALIBER (CArdiovascular research using LInked Bespoke studies and Electronic health Records) programme to assemble a cohort of 1Â·25 million patients, 30 years of age or older and initially free from cardiovascular disease, a fifth of whom received blood pressure-lowering treatments. We studied the heterogeneity in the age-specific associations of clinically measured blood pressure with 12 acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases, and estimated the lifetime risks (up to 95 years of age) and cardiovascular disease-free life-years lost adjusted for other risk factors at index ages 30, 60, and 80 years. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01164371.<br />FINDINGS: During 5Â·2 years median follow-up, we recorded 83,098 initial cardiovascular disease presentations. In each age group, the lowest risk for cardiovascular disease was in people with systolic blood pressure of 90-114 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of 60-74 mm Hg, with no evidence of a J-shaped increased risk at lower blood pressures. The effect of high blood pressure varied by cardiovascular disease endpoint, from strongly positive to no effect. Associations with high systolic blood pressure were strongest for intracerebral haemorrhage (hazard ratio 1Â·44 [95% CI 1Â·32-1Â·58]), subarachnoid haemorrhage (1Â·43 [1Â·25-1Â·63]), and stable angina (1Â·41 [1Â·36-1Â·46]), and weakest for abdominal aortic aneurysm (1Â·08 [1Â·00-1Â·17]). Compared with diastolic blood pressure, raised systolic blood pressure had a greater effect on angina, myocardial infarction, and peripheral arterial disease, whereas raised diastolic blood pressure had a greater effect on abdominal aortic aneurysm than did raised systolic pressure. Pulse pressure associations were inverse for abdominal aortic aneurysm (HR per 10 mm Hg 0Â·91 [95% CI 0Â·86-0Â·98]) and strongest for peripheral arterial disease (1Â·23 [1Â·20-1Â·27]). People with hypertension (blood pressure â‰¥140/90 mm Hg or those receiving blood pressure-lowering drugs) had a lifetime risk of overall cardiovascular disease at 30 years of age of 63Â·3% (95% CI 62Â·9-63Â·8) compared with 46Â·1% (45Â·5-46Â·8) for those with normal blood pressure, and developed cardiovascular disease 5Â·0 years earlier (95% CI 4Â·8-5Â·2). Stable and unstable angina accounted for most (43%) of the cardiovascular disease-free years of life lost associated with hypertension from index age 30 years, whereas heart failure and stable angina accounted for the largest proportion (19% each) of years of life lost from index age 80 years.<br />INTERPRETATION: The widely held assumptions that blood pressure has strong associations with the occurrence of all cardiovascular diseases across a wide age range, and that diastolic and systolic associations are concordant, are not supported by the findings of this high-resolution study. Despite modern treatments, the lifetime burden of hypertension is substantial. These findings emphasise the need for new blood pressure-lowering strategies, and will help to inform the design of randomised trials to assess them.<br />FUNDING: Medical Research Council, National Institute for Health Research, and Wellcome Trust.","24881994","2014","5"

Following risk adjustment with multivariable logistic regression modelling, patient related factors associated with significantly higher risks of prolonged opioid use included younger age, lower household income, specific comorbidities (diabetes, heart failure, pulmonary disease), and use of specific drugs preoperatively (benzodiazepines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors). The type of surgical procedure was also highly associated with prolonged opioid use. Compared with open radical prostatectomies, both open and minimally invasive thoracic procedures were associated with significantly higher risks (odds ratio 2.58, 95% confidence interval 2.03 to 3.28 and 1.95 1.36 to 2.78, respectively). Conversely, open and minimally invasive major gynaecological procedures were associated with significantly lower risks (0.73, 0.55 to 0.98 and 0.45, 0.33 to 0.62, respectively).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 3% of previously opioid naÃ¯ve patients continued to use opioids for more than 90 days after major elective surgery. Specific patient and surgical characteristics were associated with the development of prolonged postoperative use of opioids. Our findings can help better inform understanding about the long term risks of opioid treatment for acute postoperative pain and define patient subgroups that warrant interventions to prevent progression to prolonged postoperative opioid use.","24519537","2014",\N
"1530","Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia following multiple wasp stings.","The American journal of emergency medicine","Massive wasp envenomation can cause not only severe immediate allergic reactions and anaphylaxis but also severe delayed toxin-mediated systemic reactions, including hemolysis, coagulopathy, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and hepatotoxicity. However, reports of the latter type of reactions are rare. The subject of this case report, a 66-year-old man, was stung more than 30 times during an attack by wasps. Although he initially complained of pain, he showed no signs of anaphylaxis during observation in an emergency department. Twenty hours after envenomation, he was admitted to the hospital because of vomiting, abdominal pain, and lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Mesenteric ischemia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and hepatotoxicity were diagnosed as delayed toxin-mediated systemic reactions resulting from massive wasp envenomation. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography findings, which included no thrombi or emboli but did reveal the abrupt tapering of mesenteric arteries, strongly suggested that the ischemia was due to nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia. Immediately after diagnosis, an emergency laparotomy was performed. Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia was finally diagnosed via a histologic examination of the resected small bowel. We present the first case report of nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia consequent to wasp stings.","24428985","2014","6"
"1531","The incidence of intraabdominal abscess formation following laparoscopic appendicectomy in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques. Part A","AIMS: Recent systematic reviews have suggested an increased incidence of intraabdominal abscess (IAA) formation following laparoscopic appendicectomy (LA) compared with the open approach (OA). As the majority of these analyses have focused on appendicectomy in adults, our aim was to review the evidence base for pediatric patients.<br />SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We performed a comprehensive review of relevant studies published between 1990 and 2012. Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to identify studies that investigated the incidence of IAA following LA and OA in pediatric patients. The primary outcome measure in the present meta-analysis was IAA formation, and secondary outcomes included wound infection (WI) and incidence of postoperative small bowel obstruction (SBO).<br />RESULTS: Sixty-six studies with a total of 22,060 pediatric patients were included: 56.5% OA and 43.5% LA. There was no overall difference in the incidence of IAA formation: 2.7% for OA (333/12,460) versus 2.9% for LA (282/9600) (P=.25). However, OA patients had a higher incidence of wound infection: 3.7% for OA (337/9228) versus 2.2% for LA (183/8154) (P<.001). Moreover, the incidence of SBO was lower in patients undergoing LA: 0.4% LA (86/5767) versus 1.5% (29/6840) (P<.001).<br />CONCLUSIONS: The IAA incidence is comparable in LA versus OA in pediatric patients. LA confers a significantly lower risk of other postoperative complications, including WI and SBO.","24001159","2013","9"

The American Society of Extracorporeal Technology (AmSECT) first published its Essentials for Perfusion Practice, Clinical Function: Conduct of Extracorporeal Circulation in 1993. The International Consortium for Evidence-Based Perfusion (ICEBP), a committee within AmSECT, was tasked with updating this document in 2010. The aim of this report is to describe the method of development and content of AmSECT's new professional standards and guidelines. The ICEBP committee independently evaluated and provided input regarding the current \"Essentials and Guidelines.\" Structural changes were made to the entire document, and a draft document was developed, presented, and circulated to the AmSECT Board of Directors and broader membership for comment. Informed by these reviews, a revised document was then presented to the Society for a membership vote. The final document consists of 15 areas of practice covered by 50 Standards and 38 Guidelines (see Appendix 1) with the first standard focusing on the development of institutional protocols to support their implementation and use. A majority of the membership voted to accept the document (81.2% of the voting membership accepting, 18.8% rejecting). After an audit of the balloting process by AmSECT's Ethics Committee, the results were reported to the membership and the document was officially adopted on July 24, 2013. The Standards and Guidelines will serve as a useful guide for cardiac surgical teams that wish to develop institution-specific standards and guidelines to improve the reliability, safety, and effectiveness of adult cardiopulmonary bypass. The ICEBP recognizes that the development of a Standards and Guidelines statement alone will not change care. Safe, reliable, and effective care will be best served through the development and implementation of institutional protocols based on these standards. AmSECT's Standards and Guidelines for Perfusion Practice reflect the changing landscape of our profession as we work toward a safer and optimal provision of cardiopulmonary bypass for all our patients as well as a work environment that is supportive of delivering this care.<br />KEYWORDS: standards, guidelines, cardiopulmonary bypass, perfusion, cardiac surgery.","24303597","2013","9"

Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed a cystic structure in the right adnexa, probably with torsion. Computerized tomography of abdomen and pelvis showed a large pelvic cyst which arose most likely from the left ovary. An urgent laparotomy was done, which however showed a twisted para-ovarian cyst with a twisted fallopian tube on the left side. The para-ovarian cyst was removed along with left sided fallopian tube and the patient made an uneventful recovery. Torsion of a para-ovarian cyst and fallopian tube is rare, but it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen in women who are in the reproductive age group.","24995222","2014","5"
"1535","Association of CTRC and SPINK1 gene variants with recurrent hospitalizations for pancreatitis or acute abdominal pain in lipoprotein lipase deficiency.","Frontiers in genetics","BACKGROUND: There are important inter-individual variations in the incidence and severity of acute pancreatitis in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Several genes involved in triglyceride-rich lipoprotein metabolism or serine proteases pathways are known to influence the risk of pancreatitis.<br />AIM: To evaluate the association between genes regulating serine proteases, chymotrypsin C (CTRC) and serine peptidase inhibitor kazal type1 (SPINK1), and recurrence of hospitalizations for acute pancreatitis or severe abdominal pain in patients with Lipoprotein Lipase Deficiency (LPLD), a rare and extreme monogenic model of severe hypertriglyceridemia and pancreatitis.<br />METHOD: The CTRC and SPINK1 genes promoter and coding regions sequencing has been performed in a sample of 38 LPLD adults (22 men and 16 women) and 100 controls (53 men and 47 women). Estimation of the association of CTRC and SPINK1 gene variants or combinations of variants with history of hospitalizations for pancreatitis or acute abdominal pain in LPLD was investigated using non-parametric analyses with correction for multiple testing and logistic regression models controlling for age, gender, family history, and life habits.<br />RESULTS: Gene sequencing followed by genotype-stratified analyses of the CTRC and SPINK1 genes in LPLD and controls revealed a positive association between recurrence of hospitalizations and the rs545634 (CTRC)-rs11319 (SPINK1) combination [OR = 41.4 (CI: 2.0-848.0); p = 0.016]. In all models, a positive family history of pancreatitis was a significant predictor of recurrent hospitalizations independently of the contribution of SPINK1 or CTRC (p < 0.001).<br />CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a positive family history of pancreatitis and genetic markers in the serine protease pathways could be associated with a risk of recurrent hospitalization for acute pancreatitis in severe hypertriglyceridemia due to LPLD.","24795752","2014",\N

We performed a large prospective study to investigate whether synthetic human secretin (RG1068)-stimulated MRCP detects pancreatic duct abnormalities with higher levels of sensitivity than MRCP.<br />METHODS: We performed a phase 3, multicenter, baseline-controlled study of patients with acute or acute recurrent pancreatitis who were scheduled to undergo endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) between March 26, 2008, and October 28, 2009. Patients underwent a baseline MRCP that was immediately followed by administration of RG1068 and repeat MRCP and then underwent ERCP within 30 days; they were followed up for 30 days. MRCP and ERCP images were read centrally by 3 radiologists and 2 endoscopists, respectively, who were all independent and blinded; pancreatic duct abnormalities were evaluated. The accuracy of MRCP was evaluated using ERCP as the standard.<br />RESULTS: In total, 258 patients were enrolled in the study; 251 MRCP image sets were assessed, and 236 patients had evaluable ERCPs. Pancreatic duct abnormalities were observed in 60.2% of ERCP images. All radiologists identified duct abnormalities in RG1068-cinÃ© MRCP image sets with significantly higher levels of sensitivity (P < .0001) than in images from MRCP, with minimal loss of specificity. Adverse events were reported in 38.0% of patients after MRCP and 68.1% after ERCP. Of the 55 patients who experienced a serious adverse event, 3 (1.2%) and 52 (20.5%) of the events were reported to be temporally associated with MRCP and ERCP, respectively. The adverse events most frequently considered related to RG1068 were nausea, abdominal pain, and flushing; most were mild.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Compared with images from MRCP, those from RG1068-stimulated MRCP are improved in many aspects and could aid in diagnosis and clinical decision making for patients with acute, acute recurrent, or chronic pancreatitis. RG1068-enhanced MRCP might also better identify patients in need of therapeutic ERCP (ClinicalTrials.gov, Number: NCT00660335).","24906040","2014","9"

To the best of our knowledge this is the first reported case of appendicial gangliocytic paraganglioma with features suggestive of malignancy in the modern literature. Van Eeden S. et al. reported the first case of appendicial paraganglioma in a 47 year old man who also presented with acute appendicitis. The appendectomy specimen showed a distended appendix with thickened wall, and a 1.3 cm mucosal based yellow lesion. Microscopically this lesion was centered in the submucosa and consisted of three different cell types: (a) epithelioid cells with pale eosinophilic finely granular cytoplasm containing bland oval nucleus with stippled chromatin, that form solid nests lying in a trabecular pattern and in formations reminiscent of 'Zellballen' as seen in paragangliomas (b) second type cells have large vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli and abundant cytoplasm that are scattered singly, (c) third type cells with bland elongated nuclei form broad fascicle and envelop the epithelioid and ganglion cells. Immunohistochemical analysis showed the epithelioid cell nests immunoreactive for synaptophysin and the ganglion-like cells and spindle Schwann cells to be immunoreactive for S100 protein, whereas all three cells populations were negative for CAM5.2 and Pancytokeratin. We do believe that an accurate diagnosis of Gangliocytic paraganglioma (GP) of the appendix was rendered, detailed microscopic examination of doubled hematoxylin and eosinophil stained sections as well as the immunohistochemical phenotype of the three components have been undertaken to confirm the diagnosis of GP.","24040463","2013",\N

This is a report of a complex patient presenting with an appendix mass, whose surgery was deferred due to severe co-morbidities and who later died from severe metastatic disease. A 65-year-old lady presented with right iliac fossa pain and a mass. She was treated for an appendix mass initially and when the mass failed to resolve after four weeks, she was thoroughly investigated for the possibility of a tumour. Severe co-morbities had a significant impact on her management as definitive surgery was delayed. She represented 10 months after the initial admission with small bowel obstruction and died of metastatic caecal cancer. Management of appendix mass must entail a careful approach to investigating and treatment with emphasis on early intervention if the mass does not resolve promptly.

"1540","Hemoglobin Bohr effects: atomic origin of the histidine residue contributions.","Biochemistry","The Bohr effect in hemoglobin, which refers to the dependence of the oxygen affinity on the pH, plays an important role in its cooperativity and physiological function. The dominant contribution to the Bohr effect arises from the difference in the pKa values of His residues of the unliganded (deoxy) and liganded (carbonmonoxy) structures. Using recent high resolution structures, the residue pKa values corresponding to the two structures are calculated. The method is based on determining the electrostatic interactions between residues in the protein, relative to those of the residue in solution, by use of the linearized finite difference Poisson-Boltzmann equation and Monte Carlo sampling of protonation states. Given that good agreement is obtained with the available experimental values for the contribution of His residues in HbA to the Bohr effect, the calculated results are used to determine the atomic origin of the pKa shift between deoxy and carbonmonoxy HbA. The contributions to the pKa shift calculated by means of the linear response approximation show that the salt bridge involving His146 plays an important role in the alkaline Bohr effect, as suggested by Perutz but that other interactions are significant as well. A corresponding analysis is made for the contribution of His143 to the acid Bohr effect for which there is no proposed explanation. The method used is summarized and the program by which it is implemented is described in the Appendix .","24224786","2013","11"

But few studies compare the outcomes of LA compared with open appendectomy (OA). We investigated clinical outcomes to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LA compared with OA in pregnant women.<br />METHODS: We recruited consecutive pregnant patients with a diagnosis of acute appendicitis who were undergoing LA or OA between May 2007 and August 2011 into the study.<br />RESULTS: Sixty-one patients (22 LA and 39 OA) enrolled in our study. There were no significant differences in duration of surgery, postoperative complication rate and obstetric and fetal outcomes, including incidence of preterm labour, delivery type, gestation age at delivery, birth weight and APGAR scores between the 2 groups. However, the LA group had shorter time to first flatus (2.4 Â± 0.4 d v. 4.0 Â± 1.7 d, p = 0.034), earlier time to oral intake (2.3 Â± 1.6 d v. 4.1 Â± 1.9 d, p = 0.023) and shorter postoperative hospital stay (4.2 Â± 2.9 d v. 6.9 Â± 3.7 d, p = 0.043) than the OA group.<br />CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic appendectomy is a clinically safe and effective procedure in all trimesters of pregnancy and should be considered as a standard treatment alternative to OA.

The endostapler possibly provides an easier and safer closure of the appendiceal stump, but at greater expense. This study aimed to compare two strategies for closure of the appendiceal stump in a large retrospective cohort of patients.<br />METHODS: This study reviewed patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis in three academic hospitals and two regional hospitals in The Netherlands during the period 1 January 2007 to 30 June 2011. The endostapler was routinely used in two hospitals and selectively used in the remaining three hospitals. Both strategies were compared for complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification.<br />RESULTS: A total of 1,036 patients were analyzed according to the strategy followed. The 571 patients in the first group were routinely treated with the endostapler. For the 465 patients in the second group, the intentional method of stump closure was with endoloops. The endostapler was used when indicated for 69 of these patients. The patient characteristics did not differ between the two groups. The groups also did not differ significantly in number of intra- and postoperative complications. In both groups, 4.3Â % of the patients had complications classified as grade 3 or higher. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of intraabdominal abscesses (3.2Â % vs. 4.3) or wound infections (0.4 and 1.5Â %). In a multivariate analysis, the chosen strategy for stump closure was not a significant predictor for postoperative complications.<br />CONCLUSION: Routine use of the endostapler showed no clinical advantages over the use of endoloops with selective endostapler closure. The latter strategy is preferable because it is more cost effective.","24048816","2014","2"

It can affect the autonomic, peripheral, and central nervous system. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is a clinicoradiological entity characterized by headache, seizures, altered consciousness, and visual disorder associated with potentially reversible neuroradiological abnormalities predominantly in the parieto-occipital lobes. We report a child with acute intermittent porphyria who presented with radiological manifestations suggestive of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.<br />PATIENT: A 9-year-old girl underwent an appendectomy after developing abdominal pain. She subsequently developed bilateral visual disturbance, confusion, seizures, hypertension, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, dark tea-colored urine, and recurrent abdominal pain.<br />RESULTS: Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed hyperintense gyriform lesions on T2-weighted images and hypointense to isointense lesions on T1-weighted images in both parieto-occipital lobes with mild enhancement. The diagnosis of acute intermittent porphyria was confirmed by increased urinary excretion of porphyrin precursors. Her clinical signs gradually improved after intravenous high-dose glucose treatment and symptomatic therapies. A repeat magnetic resonance imaging confirmed complete resolution of the parieto-occipital lesions, suggesting with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.<br />CONCLUSIONS: The association of abdominal pain, mental status changes, and autonomic dysfunction should arouse the suspicion of acute intermittent porphyria. Acute intermittent porphyria can be associated with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.","25035140","2014","9"

In incorporates changes in the experts×³ consensus that occurred between 2006 and 2012 as well as information regarding newly developed and recently published clinical trials.<br />METHODS: Using a 44-item questionnaire, an expert consensus was obtained on pharmacological treatment strategies for (1) non-psychotic MDD, (2) psychotic MDD, (3) dysthymia and depression subtypes, (4) continuous and maintenance treatment, and (5) special populations; consensus was also obtained regarding (6) the choice of an antidepressant (AD) in the context of safety and adverse effects, and (7) non-pharmacological biological therapies.<br />RESULTS: AD monotherapy was recommended as the first-line strategy for nonpsychotic depression in adults, children and adolescents, elderly adults, and patients with postpartum depression or premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The combination of AD and atypical antipsychotics (AAP) was recommended for psychotic depression. The duration of the initial AD treatment for psychotic depression depends on the number of depressive episodes. Most experts recommended stopping the initial AD and AAP therapy after a certain period in patients with one or two depressive episodes. However, for those with three or more episodes, maintenance of the initial treatment was recommended for as long as possible. Monotherapy with various selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) was recommended for dysthymic disorder and melancholic type MDD.<br />CONCLUSION: The pharmacological treatment strategy of KMAP-DD 2012 is similar to that of KMAP-DD 2006; however, the preference for the first-line use of AAPs was stronger in 2012 than in 2006.","25010375","2014","10"
"1548","Administration and environment considerations in computer-based sports-concussion assessment.","Neuropsychology review","Computer-based testing has become a vital tool for the assessment of sport-related concussion (SRC). An increasing number of papers have been published on this topic, focusing on subjects such as the purpose and validity of baseline testing, the performance of special populations on computer-based tests, the psychometric properties of different computerized neurocognitive tools, and considerations for valid and reliable administration of these tools. The current paper describes several considerations regarding computerized test design, input and output devices, and testing environment that should be described explicitly when administering computer-based cognitive testing, regardless of whether the assessment is used for clinical or research purposes. The paper also reviews the conclusions of recent literature (2007-2013) using computer-based testing for the assessment of SRC, with special attention to the methods used in these studies. We also present an appendix checklist for clinicians and researchers that may be helpful in ensuring proper attention to factors that could influence the reliability and validity of computer-based cognitive testing. We believe that explicit attention to these technological factors may lead to the development of standards for the development and implementation of computer-based tests. Such standards have the potential to enhance the accuracy and utility of computer-based tests in SRC.","24306286","2013","12"

An intestinal ischemia was suspected and an exploratory laparotomy was performed. No abnormalities were found during surgery and five days later the patient was transferred to our institution. On admission, the patient presented a distended abdomen and paraparesis. The spinal tap showed hemorrhagic CSF and the MRI a subacute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) of the dorsal-lumbar spine. Two days later, the patient suffered an episode of sudden headache. The CT scan revealed an acute SAH at the posterior fossa and digital subtraction angiography a dissection of the right V4 segment. Spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage is a rare syndrome particularly when associated with dissecting aneurysms of the intracranial segment of the vertebral artery. SSAH should be considered early in the differential diagnosis of any case with sudden back or abdominal pain of unknown etiology, even in the absence of neurological deficits.","24028918","2012","5"

Here, we report a rare case complicated with appendicitis, duodenum perforation, and transient delirious behavior after influenza A viral infection in a pediatric patient aged 14 years. The transient delirious behavior could be attributed to postinfectious encephalopathy. The perforated peptic ulcer could have resulted from influenza infection, could have been an adverse event related to oseltamivir administration, or could have been a complication of preceding gastroenteritis.

Results from a rigorous validation protocol.","Gut and liver","BACKGROUND/AIMS: Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) is being increasingly reported in patients with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) with worsened outcomes. The present study was undertaken to evaluate intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) as a marker of severity in the entire spectrum of acute pancreatitis and to ascertain the relationship between IAP and development of complications in patients with SAP.<br />METHODS: IAP was measured via the transvesical route by measurements performed at admission, once after controlling pain and then every 4 hours. Data were collected on the length of the hospital stay, the development of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), multiorgan failure, the extent of necrosis, the presence of infection, pleural effusion, and mortality.<br />RESULTS: In total, 40 patients were enrolled and followed up for 30 days. The development of IAH was exclusively associated with SAP with an APACHE II score â‰¥8 and/or persistent SIRS, identifying all patients who were going to develop abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). The presence of ACS was associated with a significantly increased extent of pancreatic necrosis, multiple organ failure, and mortality. The mean admission IAP value did not differ significantly from the value obtained after pain control or the maximum IAP measured in the first 5 days.<br />CONCLUSIONS: IAH is reliable marker of severe disease, and patients who manifest organ failure, persistent SIRS, or an Acute Physiology and Chronic health Evaluation II score â‰¥8 should be offered IAP surveillance. Severe pancreatitis is not a homogenous entity.","24312716","2013","11"

Second, the cellular composition of the inflammatory infiltrate associated with the vascular lesions in histological samples (ileum, colon, rectum, duodenum) were investigated to identify possible treatment targets. Immunohistochemistry was done with antibodies against CD20, CD3 and CD34. Samples from a healthy control group (n = 15) were used for comparison.<br />RESULTS: Mean age at onset of the first symptoms of vasculitis was 48 Â± 21.3 years. At time of diagnosis GI symptoms were present in five out of seven patients (71%) and occurred during relapse of the vasculitis in two patients (29%). All patients had abdominal pain, four of seven (57%) had an acute kidney injury and three patients required renal replacement therapy. At the time of diagnosis five of seven patients (71%) required surgery and mean Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) on admission was high (26.3 Â± 7.7). Regarding outcome, one patient died due to gastrointestinal bleeding. Histological analysis showed significantly higher expression of CD3 in this patient compared to the control group (P = 0.02). Analysis of expression of CD20 and CD34 showed no statistically significant differences between patients with GPA and MPA with GI involvement compared to the control group.<br />CONCLUSIONS: GI involvement in GPA and MPA is rare.

"1554","The evolution of pollinator-plant interaction types in the Araceae.","Evolution; international journal of organic evolution","Most plant-pollinator interactions are mutualistic, involving rewards provided by flowers or inflorescences to pollinators. Antagonistic plant-pollinator interactions, in which flowers offer no rewards, are rare and concentrated in a few families including Araceae. In the latter, they involve trapping of pollinators, which are released loaded with pollen but unrewarded. To understand the evolution of such systems, we compiled data on the pollinators and types of interactions, and coded 21 characters, including interaction type, pollinator order, and 19 floral traits. A phylogenetic framework comes from a matrix of plastid and new nuclear DNA sequences for 135 species from 119 genera (5342 nucleotides). The ancestral pollination interaction in Araceae was reconstructed as probably rewarding albeit with low confidence because information is available for only 56 of the 120-130 genera. Bayesian stochastic trait mapping showed that spadix zonation, presence of an appendix, and flower sexuality were correlated with pollination interaction type. In the Araceae, having unisexual flowers appears to have provided the morphological precondition for the evolution of traps. Compared with the frequency of shifts between deceptive and rewarding pollination systems in orchids, our results indicate less lability in the Araceae, probably because of morphologically and sexually more specialized inflorescences.","24274161","2014","5"

This study examines patient outcomes and critically evaluates its patterns of recurrences relative to the site of metastatic origin.<br />METHODS: Patients treated with CS/IPC from 2000 to 2012 where PM arose from a primary tumour of the appendix, colon and rectum were identified from a prospective database for retrospective evaluation. The primary endpoints were survival (overall and disease-free), and secondary end points include patterns of recurrence and prognostic factors associated with overall outcomes.<br />RESULTS: Two hundred and eleven patients were followed up for a median of 23.3 months (range 1â€“156). Overall median survival was 46.8 months, and the 1-, 3-, 5-year survival rates were 87, 56 and 42 %, respectively. The 5-year survival of patients with appendiceal, colonic and rectal PM was 55, 33 and 20 %, respectively. Tumour origin was the only independent prognostic factor associated with overall survival (p = 0.03). Recurrences were more common in patients of colorectal origin over appendiceal origin (p\\0.001) and were more likely to be of a systemic nature (p = 0.05).<br />CONCLUSION: CS/IPC provides an option for improved survival in patients with PM of lower gastrointestinal origin and appears to be most promising in patients with disease of appendiceal origin.","24052322","2013","11"
"1556","Comparison of the effect of propofol and sevoflurane anaesthesia on acute and chronic postoperative pain after hysterectomy.","Anaesthesia and intensive care","There is some evidence that propofol may reduce acute postoperative pain; however, the results are inconsistent. Furthermore, there is a paucity of information about the type of anaesthesia and chronic pain. This study was designed to evaluate the hypothesis that propofol reduces acute and chronic postoperative pain compared with sevoflurane. In a randomised, prospective, double-blind trial, we assigned 80 patients having open total abdominal hysterectomy surgery to anaesthesia with either sevoflurane or propofol. Anaesthesia was titrated to clinical needs and bispectral index values to between 40 and 60. Postoperative pain was managed with pethidine and diclofenac. Acute postoperative pain for 24 hours and chronic postoperative pain at one and three months after surgery were evaluated. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to evaluate patient anxiety and depression after one and three months. There were no significant differences between the groups for opioid consumption or opioid-induced side-effects. Pain scores in the first four hours were significantly higher in the sevoflurane group. Persistent surgical pain was observed less frequently (7 out of 40 patients in the propofol group and 21 out of 40 in the sevoflurane group at three months post-surgery, P <0.01) and pain scores were lower at one and three months in the propofol group (0.78Â±0.55 versus 2.23Â±0.73 for the sevoflurane group at three months post-surgery, P <0.01). Anxiety and depression scores were significantly lower in the propofol group at three months. In this study, general anaesthesia with propofol was associated with reduced early acute postoperative and persistent pain, compared to sevoflurane-based anaesthesia, among patients undergoing open abdominal hysterectomy.","24794477","2014","5"

Fourteen patients underwent concomitant augmentation enterocystoplasty. Indications for surgery included neurogenic bladder (n = 11) and urethral dysfunction (n = 4). The patients were evaluated postoperatively using cystography. Quality of life (QoL) was evaluated using an internally developed questionnaire.<br />RESULTS: All surgeries were successfully completed with no conversions. Operating time was always <5â€‰h. The mean estimated blood loss was 150â€‰mL and the mean follow-up was 22 months. Early postoperative complications included deep retrovesical abscess (n = 2) and upper urinary tract infections (n = 4), and one patient had peri-operative cardiac failure. Late postoperative complications included stomal stenosis (n = 2), persistent low-pressure bladder incontinence (n = 1) and recurrent infections (n = 1). Surgical excision of the conduit was necessary in one patient. Postoperatively, patients showed complete bladder emptying and no leak on follow-up cystography. According to our QoL questionnaire, 13/15 patients did not regret the surgery.<br />CONCLUSIONS: While a longer follow-up is needed to assess the durability of our results, this series shows that the laparoscopic and robot-assisted approaches for the construction of continent urinary diversions are feasible and safe in an adult population.","23937141","2013","11"

WHO criteria measure solid tumors in two-dimensions, whereas RECIST measurements use only one-dimension which is considered to be more reproducible (1, 2, 3,4,5). These criteria have been widely used as the only imaging biomarker approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (6). In order to measure tumor response to anti-tumor drugs on images with accuracy, therefore, a robust quality assurance (QA) procedures and corresponding QA phantom are needed. To address this need, the authors constructed a preclinical multimodality (for ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) phantom using tissue-mimicking (TM) materials based on the limited number of target lesions required by RECIST by revising a Gammex US commercial phantom (7). The Appendix in Lee et al. demonstrates the procedures of phantom fabrication (7). In this article, all protocols are introduced in a step-by-step fashion beginning with procedures for preparing the silicone molds for casting tumor-simulating test objects in the phantom, followed by preparation of TM materials for multimodality imaging, and finally construction of the preclinical multimodality QA phantom. The primary purpose of this paper is to provide the protocols to allow anyone interested in independently constructing a phantom for their own projects. QA procedures for tumor size measurement, and RECIST, WHO and volume measurement results of test objects made at multiple institutions using this QA phantom are shown in detail in Lee et al.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) also recently revised their Clinical Practice Guidelines for ADHD; whereas prior guidelines were focused on children aged 6-12, the new guidelines extend up to age 17. An understanding of these revised diagnostic criteria and clinical guidelines is essential for pediatricians and others who care for adolescents. In addition to providing an updated review of the clinical approach to assessment and treatment of ADHD in adolescents, recent findings are briefly described relating to common comorbidities, psychosocial risks, and long-term outcome.<br />SUMMARY: Diagnosis and treatment of adolescents with ADHD present unique challenges and obstacles. Clinicians need to be careful and deliberate in their evaluation of a teenager with recent-onset symptoms suggestive of ADHD, giving consideration to other conditions that could mimic ADHD and screening for common comorbid conditions. In terms of treatment of adolescents, the AAP recommends medication as the first-line intervention, noting that stimulants have a much broader evidence base and larger effect size than nonstimulants. Although clinicians now have a multitude of medication formulations to choose among, they must also be vigilant to the potential for stimulant misuse and diversion.","24370490","2014","2"

Although an association between celiac disease and HFMS has not been described, this patient's immunologic disruption could have favored the development of infection and ultimately HFMS.","24180226","2013",\N
"1573","Impact of molecular alterations and targeted therapy in appendiceal adenocarcinomas.","The oncologist","UNLABELLED: Appendiceal adenocarcinomas (AAs) are rare and this has limited their molecular understanding. The purpose of our study was to characterize the molecular profile of AA and explore the role of targeted therapy against cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).<br />PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 607 patients with AA at a single institution. A total of 149 patients underwent molecular testing for at least one of the following: activating mutations in KRAS, BRAF, cKIT, EGFR, or PI3K; protein expression of c-KIT or COX-2; or microsatellite instability (MSI) status by immunohistochemistry. Kaplan-Meier product limit method and log-rank test were used to estimate overall survival (OS) and to determine associations among OS, COX-2 expression, KRAS mutations, and other characteristics.<br />RESULTS: Age, grade, stage, signet ring cells, mucinous histology, and completeness of cytoreduction score correlated with survival outcomes. COX-2 expression, KRAS, PI3K, and BRAF mutations were seen in 61%, 55%, 17%, and 4% of patients, respectively. High MSI was seen in 6% of patients. KRAS mutation was strongly associated with well differentiated or moderately differentiated AA (p < .01). COX-2 expression (p = .33) and the presence of KRAS mutation (p = .91) had no impact on OS. The use of celecoxib in patients whose tumors expressed COX-2 (p = .84) and the use of cetuximab or panitumumab in patients with KRAS wild-type tumors (p = .83) also had no impact on OS.<br />CONCLUSION: In this cohort, we demonstrated that COX-2 expression and KRAS mutations were frequently seen in AA, although neither exhibited any prognostic significance. MSI was infrequent in AA. Targeted therapy against COX-2 and EGFR appeared to provide no clinical benefit. Well and moderately differentiated AA were molecularly distinct from poorly differentiated AA.","24149137","2013",\N
"1574","Analysis of 320 gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors identifies TS expression as independent biomarker for survival.","International journal of cancer. Journal international du cancer","Thymidylate synthase (TS), a critical enzyme for DNA synthesis and repair, is both a potential tumor prognostic biomarker as well as a tumorigenic oncogene in animal models. We have now studied the clinical implications of TS expression in gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and compared these results to other cell cycle biomarker genes. Protein tissue arrays were used to study TS, Ki-67, Rb, pRb, E2F1, p18, p21, p27 and menin expression in 320 human GEP-NETs samples. Immunohistochemical expression was correlated with univariate and multivariate predictors of survival utilizing Kaplan Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. Real time RT-PCR was used to validate these findings. We found that 78 of 320 GEP-NETs (24.4%) expressed TS. NETs arising in the colon, stomach and pancreas showed the highest expression of TS (47.4%, 42.6% and 37.3%, respectively), whereas NETs of the appendix, rectum and duodenum displayed low TS expression (3.3%, 12.9% and 15.4%, respectively). TS expression in GEP-NETs was associated with poorly differentiated endocrine carcinoma, angiolymphatic invasion, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Patients with TS-positive NETs had markedly worse outcomes than TS-negative NETs as shown by univariate (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and multivariate (pâ€‰=â€‰0.01) survival analyses. Expression of p18 predicted survival in TS-positive patients that received chemotherapy (pâ€‰=â€‰0.015). In conclusion, TS protein expression was an independent prognostic biomarker for GEP-NETs. The strong association of increased TS expression with aggressive disease and early death supports the role of TS as a cancer promoting agent in these tumors.","24347111","2014","7"

Subset analysis was performed for paediatric patients, patients who presented with perforated appendicitis and studies with long-term follow-up and surveillance for bowel obstruction and with surgery for bowel obstruction.<br />RESULTS: Overall, 29 studies comprising 159,729 patients (60,875 LA versus 98,854 OA) were included. LA was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of post-operative bowel obstruction in the general population (pooled odds ratio (POR)â€‰=â€‰0.43 [95 %C.I. 0.3-0.63]). Subset analysis demonstrated that LA significantly reduced the incidence of post-operative bowel obstruction in paediatric patients (PORâ€‰=â€‰0.48 [95 %C.I. 0.3-0.78]) and patients with perforated appendicitis (PORâ€‰=â€‰0.44 [95 %C.I. 0.26-0.74]).

Data on 1,697 Korean adults were obtained from the second and third years (2008-2009) of the fourth Korean National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey. Body fat mass was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Both linear regression analysis for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and logistic analysis for vitamin D deficiency [25(OH)D <20 ng/mL] were performed to determine significant predictors among BMI, waist circumference (WC), and body fat percentage (BF), after adjustment of multiple covariates. To explore a possible non-linear relationship between them, the fractional polynomials method was used. All analyses were conducted following stratification by sex. In linear regression analysis, BMI and WC were not associated with 25(OH)D. However, BF was inversely related to 25(OH)D, irrespective of the fat location (both appendicular and truncal fat) in both sexes. In logistic regression analysis, the highest quartile group of BF had a greater OR for vitamin D deficiency than the lower quartile groups, irrespective of the fat location and sex. However, the quartiles of BMI and WC were not associated with vitamin D deficiency. The linear relationships between BF and 25(OH)D (or vitamin D deficiency) were confirmed despite use of the fractional polynomials method. Body fat mass is inversely associated with serum 25(OH)D in Korean adults. Monitoring of vitamin D deficiency in Korean adults with high fat mass is needed.","24561974","2014",\N

The AAP has long recognized that with the ever-increasing diversity of the pediatric population in the United States, the health of all children depends on the ability of all pediatricians to practice culturally effective care. CEHC can be defined as the delivery of care within the context of appropriate physician knowledge, understanding, and appreciation of all cultural distinctions, leading to optimal health outcomes. The AAP believes that CEHC is a critical social value and that the knowledge and skills necessary for providing CEHC can be taught and acquired through focused curricula across the spectrum of lifelong learning. This statement also addresses workforce diversity, health disparities, and affirmative action. The discussion of diversity is broadened to include not only race, ethnicity, and language but also cultural attributes such as gender, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, and disability, which may affect the quality of health care. The AAP believes that efforts must be supported through health policy and advocacy initiatives to promote the delivery of CEHC and to overcome educational, organizational, and other barriers to improving workforce diversity.","24081998","2013","10"

Our objective was to assess physicians' perspectives of newborn male circumcision.<br />METHODS: A self-administered, cross-sectional electronic survey of US physicians was conducted in 2008 (N = 1500).<br />RESULTS: Approximately one-third (33.2%) of the respondents reported that their current perspective was that the medical benefits outweigh the risks associated with newborn male circumcision and less than one-third (31.1%) reported they would recommend the procedure when counseling parents.<br />CONCLUSIONS: In 2008, only about one-third of the physicians surveyed thought that the benefits of male circumcision outweighed the risks and recommended it to parents of newborn sons. These attitudes may be relevant to the declining circumcision rates in the United States. Repeat surveys may be useful, given the new AAP and ACOG recommendations.","24899259","2014","6"

This infection is rarely recognized by clinicians due to its non-specific symptoms. Lesions may occur anywhere in the GI tract but most commonly affects the terminal ileum. PATIENTs present with GI bleeding, intestinal obstruction, ulcerations, masses, and peritonitis. Serum and urine serological antigens are useful for diagnosis because they are positive in over 90% of patients with disseminated disease but may be falsely negative in patients with localized GI involvement. Although histopathology and tissue cultures are specific, limitations include insensitivity and need for invasive procedures. Antifungal agents include intravenous amphotericin B for severe or unstable disease and oral itraconazole for stable disease.<br />CASE REPORT: A 51-year-old HIV positive female presented with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed circumferential narrowing around a segment of the sigmoid colon with the cecum demonstrating irregular thickened walls. A biopsy of an obstructing duodenal mass found on endoscopy revealed granulomatous inflammation and budding yeasts consistent with Histoplasma spp. She was started on intravenous liposomal amphotericin B and after 2 weeks switched to itraconazole oral solution.

The molecular basis of ZLS is unknown. Most patients are sporadic, although familial aggregation is also observed with different inheritance patterns. We report on two unrelated children with full-blown characteristics of ZLS. Remarkable variability in expression included severity of neurocognitive involvement and extent of appendicular and facial features. In both, comparative genome hybridization array at a ~ 75 Mb resolution resulted negative, while aminoacid metabolic screening revealed high plasma levels of hypoxanthine and xanthine in one. Literature review identified 50 previously published patients (27 females, 23 males), including 14 familial, clustered in four pedigrees, and 37 sporadic. Tabulation of clinical features confirmed the core phenotype and identified developmental delay as the unique major clinical problem (occurring in 40% of the cases) with a moderately high risk of epilepsy (13%). Segregation analysis in the 20 sporadic patients with available data on healthy sibs and a single pedigree with affected sibs was significantly in contrast with an autosomal recessive mutation.

However, adequate direct evidence to identify the shape of the mortality RR functions at the high ambient concentrations observed in many places in the world is lacking.<br />OBJECTIVE: We developed RR functions over the entire global exposure range for causes of mortality in adults: ischemic heart disease (IHD), cerebrovascular disease (stroke), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer (LC). We also developed RR functions for the incidence of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) that can be used to estimate mortality and lost-years of healthy life in children < 5 years of age.<br />METHODS: We fit an integrated exposure-response (IER) model by integrating available RR information from studies of ambient air pollution (AAP), second hand tobacco smoke, household solid cooking fuel, and active smoking (AS). AS exposures were converted to estimated annual PM2.5 exposure equivalents using inhaled doses of particle mass. We derived population attributable fractions (PAFs) for every country based on estimated worldwide ambient PM2.5 concentrations.<br />RESULTS: The IER model was a superior predictor of RR compared with seven other forms previously used in burden assessments. The percent PAF attributable to AAP exposure varied among countries from 2 to 41 for IHD, 1 to 43 for stroke, < 1 to 21 for COPD, < 1 to 25 for LC, and < 1 to 38 for ALRI.<br />CONCLUSIONS: We developed a fine particulate mass-based RR model that covered the global range of exposure by integrating RR information from different combustion types that generate emissions of particulate matter.

"1594","Peritoneal adhesions after laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery.","World journal of gastroenterology : WJG","Although laparoscopy has the potential to reduce peritoneal trauma and post-operative peritoneal adhesion formation, only one randomized controlled trial and a few comparative retrospective clinical studies have addressed this issue. Laparoscopy reduces de novo adhesion formation but has no efficacy in reducing adhesion reformation after adhesiolysis. Moreover, several studies have suggested that the reduction of de novo post-operative adhesions does not seem to have a significant clinical impact. Experimental data in animal models have suggested that COâ‚‚ pneumoperitoneum can cause acute peritoneal inflammation during laparoscopy depending on the insufflation pressure and the surgery duration. Broad peritoneal cavity protection by the insufflation of a low-temperature humidified gas mixture of COâ‚‚, Nâ‚‚O and Oâ‚‚ seems to represent the best approach for reducing peritoneal inflammation due to pneumoperitoneum. However, these experimental data have not had a significant impact on the modification of laparoscopic instrumentation. In contrast, surgeons should train themselves to perform laparoscopy quickly, and they should complete their learning curves before testing chemical anti-adhesive agents and anti-adhesion barriers. Chemical anti-adhesive agents have the potential to exert broad peritoneal cavity protection against adhesion formation, but when these agents are used alone, the concentrations needed to prevent adhesions are too high and could cause major post-operative side effects. Anti-adhesion barriers have been used mainly in open surgery, but some clinical data from laparoscopic surgeries are already available. Sprays, gels, and fluid barriers are easier to apply in laparoscopic surgery than solid barriers. Results have been encouraging with solid barriers, spray barriers, and gel barriers, but they have been ambiguous with fluid barriers. Moreover, when barriers have been used alone, the maximum protection against adhesion formation has been no greater than 60%. A recent small, randomized clinical trial suggested that the combination of broad peritoneal cavity protection with local application of a barrier could be almost 100% effective in preventing post-operative adhesion formation. Future studies should confirm the efficacy of this global strategy in preventing adhesion formation after laparoscopy by focusing on clinical end points, such as reduced incidences of bowel obstruction and abdominal pain and increased fertility.","24803803","2014","5"

Laparoscopic-assisted single-port appendectomy (SPA), although combining the advantages of open and conventional laparoscopic surgery, is still not widely used in childhood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and the cost effectiveness of SPA in children. Methods. After institutional review board approval, we retrospectively evaluated 262 children who underwent SPA. The appendix was dissected outside the abdominal cavity as in open surgery. For stump closure, we used two 3/0 vicryl RB-1 sutures. Results. We identified 146 boys (55.7%) and 116 girls (44.3%). Median age at operation was 11.4 years (range, 1.1-15.9). Closure of the appendiceal stump using two sutures (cost: USD 15) was successful in all patients. Neither a stapler (cost: USD 276) nor endoloops (cost: USD 89) were used. During a follow-up of up to 69 months (range, 30-69), six obese children (2.3%, body mass index >95th percentile) developed an intra-abdominal abscess after perforated appendicitis. No insufficiency of the appendiceal stump was observed by ultrasound. Five of them were treated successfully by antibiotics, one child required drainage. Conclusion. The SPA technique with conventional extracorporal closure of the appendiceal stump is safe and cost effective. In our unit, SPA is the standard procedure for appendectomy in children.","24381754","2013",\N
"1601","Cecal volvulus.","The Indian journal of surgery","A twisted loop of the bowel and its mesentery on a fixed point is known as volvulus and it may arise more frequently in the sigmoid colon and cecum. Cecal volvulus as an uncommon cause of acute intestinal obstruction is axial twist of the cecum, ascending colon and terminal ileum around their mesenteric pedicles. Although there are many different etiologic and predisposing factors for cecal volvulus, exact etiology is most likely multifactorial in presence of mobile cecum. Its clinical presentation is highly variable, ranging from intermittent episodes of abdominal pain to abdominal catastrophe depending on pattern, severity and duration of cecal volvulus causing intestinal obstruction. Due to its rarity and nonspecific presentation, preoperative diagnosis is rarely achieved in most cases. Abdominal radiographs as an initial diagnostic test are usually abnormal and can detect cecal volvulus in half of cases. Nowadays, computerized tomography is used for more accurate diagnosis and differentiation from other acute emergent conditions. Resection with right hemicolectomy and primary ileocolic anastomosis has been recommended for surgical treatment of cecal volvulus.","24293902","2012","12"
"1602","Lithium or an atypical antipsychotic drug in the management of treatment-resistant depression: a systematic review and economic evaluation.","Health technology assessment (Winchester, England)","BACKGROUND: Patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) are those with major depressive disorder that has not responded adequately to treatment. The causes of depression are not fully understood, although there is evidence to suggest that depression is a complex interaction among biological, genetic, psychosocial and environmental factors. Strategies available for the treatment of patients with TRD include pharmacological, non-pharmacological, and psychological and psychosocial interventions. Pharmacological treatment options include switching to a different antidepressant, the addition of another antidepressant of a different class, or use of an augmenting agent, such as anticonvulsants, lithium or atypical antipsychotics (AAPs). However, there is limited evidence available on the effectiveness of these strategies in the treatment of TRD.<br />OBJECTIVES: To estimate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of augmentation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant therapy with either lithium or an AAP drug in the management of people with treatment-resistant unipolar depression, defined as failure to respond to two or more antidepressant drugs in their current episode of depression.<br />DATA SOURCES: Databases searched were Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED). All databases were searched from inception to August 2011. Additional data were obtained from manufacturers.<br />REVIEW METHODS: Systematic reviews of studies evaluating clinical effectiveness, economic analyses and quality of life (QoL) were executed. Quality assessment according to predefined criteria was undertaken independently by two reviewers. Pairwise meta-analyses and mixed-treatment comparisons (MTCs) using both fixed- and random-effects models were undertaken based on intention-to-treat analyses. A probabilistic de novo mathematical model was developed to synthesise the available data on costs and clinical outcomes from the UK NHS perspective over a 1-year time horizon (8 weeks of acute treatment captured by a decision tree and 10 months of maintenance treatment captured by a Markov model).<br />RESULTS: Twelve randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified in the review of clinical effectiveness literature; 10 considered SSRIâ€‰â€‰+â€‰â€‰AAP compared with SSRIâ€‰â€‰+â€‰â€‰placebo/no treatment, one considered SSRIâ€‰â€‰+â€‰â€‰AAP compared with SSRIâ€‰â€‰+â€‰â€‰lithium and one considered SSRIâ€‰â€‰+â€‰â€‰lithium compared with SSRIâ€‰â€‰+â€‰â€‰placebo. The RCTs included in the primary analyses used fluoxetine as the background SSRI and olanzapine as the AAP. Results of the MTC showed a non-significant trend in favour of lithium augmentation for response [lithium a priori odds ratio (OR) 1.29; 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.11 to 5.32; lithium post hoc OR 4.15; 95% CrI 0.25 to 20.34 (the trial informing the comparison with lithium reported response using two different definitions)], mean change in Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale score from baseline (mean difference -â€‰â€‰1.47, 95% CrI -â€‰â€‰9.10 to 6.41) and all-cause withdrawals (OR 0.74, 95% CrI 0.10 to 2.66). Four economic evaluations (none directly addressing the review question) and 17 studies that reported on QoL were identified and summarised in narrative reviews. The results of the de novo modelling indicate that augmentation of SSRI with lithium dominates augmentation of an SSRI with AAP (i.e. it resulted in cost savings of Â£905 per person per year and generated more health benefits, estimated to be 0.03 quality-adjusted life-years). However, sensitivity analyses showed that the model was highly sensitive to changes in acute treatment efficacy (response and remission) or discontinuation. The model was not sensitive to changes in other parameters.<br />LIMITATIONS: In patients with TRD, there is a lack of direct evidence comparing the clinical effectiveness of augmenting an SSRI with an AAP compared with augmenting with lithium. RCTs were identified which facilitated comparison of adding AAP with adding lithium via a MTC. However, variations in the definitions of response implemented in the RCTs, together with differences in patient baseline characteristics across RCTs, introduce bias into the analysis. The direction and extent of the bias is uncertain.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Augmentation of SSRIs with lithium or AAP is likely to be beneficial in people with TRD. Clinical evaluation based on the limited evidence identified in this research indicates no statistically significant difference between the two augmentation strategies. Cost-effectiveness analyses suggest that augmentation with lithium is less expensive and more effective than augmentation with AAP. However, the uncertainty in the clinical estimates of discontinuation and treatment response is reflected in the model results.

Having undergone a prior right hemicolectomy, the patient has been disease free and on surveillance with clinical and carcinogenic antigen (CEA) monitoring. The CEA was noted to be elevated and a computed tomography scan revealed peritoneal nodules throughout the abdomen with a presumptive diagnosis of pseudomyxoma peritonei (progressive peritoneal implants from a mucinous primary). Several therapeutic options were offered and the patient selected to undergo cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with the potential to receive hyperthermic interoperative chemotherapy (HIPEC). Extensive resection was performed, including removal of the entire greater omentum, partial gastrectomy, and total pelvic exenteration with end colostomy and ileal conduit. Reassessment of the peritoneal cavity after the resections revealed almost complete cytoreduction. HIPEC was performed with mitomycin C and, after drainage and abdominal washing, the intestinal segments were anastomosed and the abdominal wall closed. Seven days postoperatively, an acute abdomen with septic shock developed as a result of a leak from the ileocolonic anastomosis. The patient returned to the operating room and an exploratory laparotomy, a small bowel resection, a resection of the ileocolonic anastomosis, and an abdominal washout were performed. Edema of the bowel caused by peritonitis resulting from the anastomotic leak necessitated delayed closure of the abdominal wall. A temporary abdominal closure using the ABTheraâ„¢ Open Abdomen Negative Pressure Therapy system was applied and the abdomen was eventually closed.","24969254","2014","7"

In our institution, it is used for treatment of perforated appendicitis in children. This study evaluated the occurrence of ceftriaxone-related pseudolithiasis in this population.<br />METHODS: After obtaining IRB approval, we performed a retrospective chart review over 51 months. We included patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy for perforated appendicitis. All patients were treated with ceftriaxone post-operatively. Patients without initial or post-treatment gallbladder imaging available for review were excluded.<br />RESULTS: There were 71 patients who met inclusion criteria with a mean (Â±SD) age of 10.8 Â± 3.8 years. Of these, 14 % (n = 10) developed stones or sludge in the gallbladder. The mean duration of ceftriaxone therapy was 8.7 Â± 3.8 days. The average time to post-antibiotic imaging was 11.5 Â± 10.3 days from initiation of antibiotics. There was no significant difference in duration of ceftriaxone therapy in the children that developed pseudolithiasis or sludge (10.0 Â± 4.9 days) compared to those that did not (8.5 Â± 3.6, p = 0.26).

It has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern and is characterized by a chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis that progress to terminal renal failure during the first or second decades of life. Systemic associations of this syndrome include sensorineural hearing loss, liver fibrosis or cerebral vermis hypoplasia. Acute pancreatitis has not been previously reported in this syndrome.<br />CASE REPORT: This is a 28- years-old patient who was diagnosed to have Senior Loken syndrome at the age of 10 years because of renal impairment and tapetoretinal degeneration and was later started on regular hemodialysis. He had no family history of renal disease, hypertriglyceridemia or cholelithiasis. He presented to our center complaining of acute abdominal pain and vomiting. He had abdominal tenderness without guarding. Investigations revealed a lipase level of 3856 I U/l and an abdominal CT scan showed features of acute pancreatitis. The abdominal ultrasound showed no biliary tree malformations or gallstone obstruction. He had no history of recent drug intake or alcohol consumption and his serum triglyceride level was normal. A diagnosis of moderate acute pancreatitis was made and the patient was managed conservatively with good outcome.<br />CONCLUSION: Taking into consideration the uncertainty about the presence of liver fibrosis and the fact that imaging may have missed a passing gallstone, this case may indicate another rare systemic complication of Senior-Loken syndrome.<br />KEYWORDS: Nephronophthisis; Pancreatitis; Retinal Dystrophy; Senior -Loken.","24702534","2014","1"

We present a case of a 31-year-old who presented with acute abdominal pain at 9 weeks postpartum. On examination, the abdomen had diffuse tenderness, with rebound tenderness in the suprapubic area and in both iliac fossae. On ultrasonography, a 12.7 Ã— 8.6 Ã— 8.9-cm sized hyperechoic mass was visible on the posterior wall of the uterus. A large amount of fluid was visible in the paracolic gutters and the Pouch of Douglas (POD). The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy. A ruptured, cystic degenerated uterine fibroid with active bleeding was found, as well as approximately half a liter of free, bloodstained peritoneal fluid and pus. Myomectomy was performed, followed by evacuation of the fluid and clots. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful.

Measures of chronic disease were defined based on: 1) alveolar crestal height (ACH) measures from intraoral radiographs and tooth loss and 2) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/American Academy of Periodontology (AAP) criteria using measures of clinical attachment level and probing depth (PD). Acute oral inflammation was assessed by the percentage of gingival sites that bled upon assessment with a probe. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for periodontal disease among participants with adequate [25(OH)D â‰¥50 nmol/L] compared with deficient/inadequate [25(OH)D <50 nmol/L] vitamin D status adjusted for age, dental visit frequency, and body mass index.<br />RESULTS: No association was observed between vitamin D status and periodontal disease defined by ACH and tooth loss (adjusted OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.68 to 1.35). In contrast, women with adequate compared with deficient/inadequate vitamin D status had 33% lower odds (95% CI = 5% to 53%) of periodontal disease according to the CDC/AAP definition and 42% lower odds (95% CI = 21% to 58%) of having â‰¥50% of gingival sites that bled.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D status was inversely associated with gingival bleeding, an acute measure of oral health and inflammation, and inversely associated with clinical categories of chronic periodontal disease that incorporated PD, an indicator of oral inflammation.

However, IBD pathogenesis involves both immunological and vascular abnormalities. Using the first murine model of AA (developed by us), we aimed to determine the role of AA in modulating vascular remodelling mediated by endothelin activity in IBD.<br />METHODS: Mice with two laparotomies each served as controls (sham-sham or SS). Distal colons were harvested (four AA group colons, four SS group colons), and RNA extracted from each. The RNA was subjected to microarray analysis and RT-PCR validation. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) software was used to further analyze the microarray data.<br />RESULTS: Gene expression of seven genes closely associated with endothelin activity was examined in distal colons 3 days post-AA and 28 days post-AA. While there were no gene expression changes 3 days post-AA, the genes EDN1 (0.7-fold), EDN2 (0.8-fold) and ECE2 (0.8-fold) were downregulated (*p value <0.05) 28 days post-AA. However, EDN3 (1.3-fold) was upregulated 28 days post-AA (*p value <0.05). GSEA analysis showed downregulation of 11 gene sets (stringent cut-offs-false discovery rate <5 % and p value <0.001) associated with endothelin and endothelin-converting enzyme genes by AA, in contrast to only 1 being upregulated.<br />CONCLUSIONS: AA induces a delayed but significant suppression of genes pertaining to endothelin activity. Elucidating the pathways involved in suppression of endothelin activity and manipulation of different genes/enzymes/proteins related to endothelin activity will significantly enhance the extant repertoire of therapeutic options in IBD.","25085204","2014","11"

Part A","Human biomarker measurements in tissues including blood, breath, and urine can serve as efficient surrogates for environmental monitoring because a single biological sample integrates personal exposure across all environmental media and uptake pathways. However, biomarkers represent a \"snapshot\" in time, and risk assessment is generally based on long-term averages. In this study, a statistical approach is proposed for estimating long-term average exposures from distributions of spot biomarker measurements using intraclass correlations based upon measurement variance components from the literature. This methodology was developed and demonstrated using a log-normally distributed data set of urinary OH-pyrene taken from our own studies. The calculations are generalized for any biomarker data set of spot measures such as those from the National Health and Nutrition Evaluation Studies (NHANES) requiring only spreadsheet calculations. A three-tiered approach depending on the availability of metadata was developed for converting any collection of spot biomarkers into an estimated distribution of individual means that can then be compared to a biologically relevant risk level.

Therefore the pediatrician has often a precious option in the anti-inflammatory and antipyretic treatment in children instead of using steroids and paracetamol. In clinical practice ibuprofen can be used in the treatment of headache, toothache, otalgy, dysmenorrhea, neuralgia, arthralgia, myalgia, abdominal pain and fever: it is the first choice for these common diseases. However, the use of steroids is a routine, even if non-corticosteroid anti-inflammatory molecules could be useful. Certainly steroids are powerful anti-inflammatory, indicated for the treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders and in acute respiratory and allergic diseases. Beside, thanks to their chemical and pharmacological profile, they also provide patients with an antipyretic effect. However, the use of steroids must be reserved to cases in which other classical antipyretics such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are not effective. The possible side effects and risks associated with stepping down steroids must be considered. Although \"steroids-phobia\" should be discouraged, steroids are to be reserved only as the first indication.

Depending on location, it may mimic several disorders such as colonic diverticulitis and acute appendicitis. Diagnosis is sometimes performed during surgery.<br />METHODS: This is a retrospective descriptive study. The authors report the contribution of imaging for the diagnosis of appendagitis in seven patients investigated between JulyÂ 2010Â and AprilÂ 2013Â by abdominal and pelvic ultrasound or computed tomography (CT).<br />RESULTS: CT scan confirmed the diagnosis in six patients avoiding unnecessary surgery and hospitalization. The seventh patient was a pregnant woman in whom the diagnosis of appendagitis was made during surgery for appendicitis.<br />CONCLUSION: Appendagitis is a rare cause of acute abdominal pain. Outcome is favorable with medical treatment only. Abdominal ultrasound and CT are helpful diagnostic tests avoiding useless surgical procedure.","23978699","2014","9"
"1621","Diversity, relationships, and biogeography of the lambeosaurine dinosaurs from the European Archipelago, with description of the New Aralosaurin Canardia garonnensis.","PloS one","We provide a thorough re-evaluation of the taxonomic diversity, phylogenetic relationships, and historical biogeography of the lambeosaurine hadrosaurids from the European Archipelago. Previously published occurrences of European Lambeosaurinae are reviewed and new specimens collected from upper Maastrichtian strata of the south-central Pyrenees are described. No support is found for the recognition of European saurolophines in the available hadrosaurid materials recovered so far from this area. A new genus and species of basal lambeosaurine, Canardia garonnensis, is described on the basis of cranial and appendicular elements collected from upper Maastrichtian strata of southern France. C. garonnensis differs from all other hadrosaurids, except Aralosaurus tuberiferus, in having maxilla with prominent subrectangular rostrodorsal flange; it differs from A. tuberiferus in a few maxillary and prefrontal characters. Together with A. tuberiferus, C. garonnensis integrates the newly recognized tribe Aralosaurini. Inference of lambeosaurine interrelationships via maximum parsimony analysis indicates that the other three known European lambeosaurines are representatives of two additional subclades (tribes) of these hadrosaurids: Tsintaosaurini (Pararhabdodon isonensis) and Lambeosaurini (the Arenysaurus ardevoli-Blasisaurus canudoi clade). The tribes Aralosaurini, Tsintaosaurini, Lambeosaurini, and Parasaurolophini are formally defined and diagnosed for the first time. Three event-based quantitative methods of ancestral range reconstruction were implemented to infer the historical biogeography of European lambeosaurines: Dispersal-Vicariance Analysis, Bayesian Binary MCMC, and Dispersal-Extinction-Cladogenesis. The results of these analyses, coupled with the absence of pre-Maastrichtian lambeosaurines in the Mesozoic vertebrate fossil record of Europe, favor the hypothesis that aralosaurins and tsintaosaurins were Asian immigrants that reached the Ibero-Armorican island via dispersal events sometime during the Maastrichtian. Less conclusive is the biogeographical history of European lambeosaurins; several scenarios, occurring sometime during the Maastrichtian, are possible, from vicariance leading to the splitting of Asian or North American from European ranges to a dispersal event from North America to the European Archipelago.","23922815","2013",\N

"1623","Gorham-Stout disease and generalized lymphatic anomaly--clinical, radiologic, and histologic differentiation.","Skeletal radiology","PURPOSE: Gorham-Stout disease (GSD) is a rare vascular disorder of lymphatic origin characterized by progressive osteolysis. Generalized lymphatic anomaly (GLA) is a multisystem disorder that also commonly affects bone. We hypothesized that Gorham-Stout disease is different from other osseous lymphatic anomalies. We proposed to discriminate these entities by analyzing findings on skeletal imaging.<br />METHODS: Clinical data, imaging studies, and histopathologic findings were retrospectively reviewed in patients presenting to our Vascular Anomalies Center with lymphatic anomalies of bone.<br />FINDINGS: Within a cohort of 51 patients with lymphatic disorder and radiological evidence of bony involvement, two distinct categories emerged. Nineteen patients met the imaging criteria for GSD: progressive osteolysis with resorption and cortical loss. Thirty-two were categorized as GLA: Discrete radiolucencies and increasing numbers of bone affected over time, but without evidence of progressive osteolysis. The ribs were the most common site in both groups, followed by the cranium, clavicle, and cervical spine in GSD, and thoracic spine, humerus, and femur in GLA. Fewer bones were involved in GSD, with relative sparing of the appendicular skeleton. Associated infiltrative soft tissue abnormality was seen in 18 in GSD, but only six with GLA. Macrocystic lymphatic malformations were identified in 14 with GLA, but none with GSD.<br />CONCLUSIONS: There are significant radiological differences between GSD and GLA, although there are some overlapping features. The major distinguishing characteristic is the progressive osteolysis seen in GSD. Findings suggestive of GLA are more extensive involvement, particularly of the appendicular skeleton, presence of discretemacrocystic lymphatic malformations and visceral organ lesions.","23371338","2013","7"

Nonmyeloablative transplantation has been attempted with degrees of preparative regimen intensity, but graft rejection and graft-vs-host disease remain significant.<br />OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy, safety, and outcome on end-organ function with this low-intensity regimen for sickle cell phenotype with or without thalassemia.<br />DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From July 16, 2004, to October 25, 2013, 30 patients aged 16-65 years with severe disease enrolled in this nonmyeloablative transplant study, consisting of alemtuzumab (1 mg/kg in divided doses), total-body irradiation (300 cGy), sirolimus, and infusion of unmanipulated filgrastim mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (5.5-31.7â€‰Ã—â€‰10(6) cells/kg) from human leukocyte antigen-matched siblings.<br />MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was treatment success at 1 year after the transplant, defined as a full donor-type hemoglobin for patients with sickle cell disease and transfusion independence for patients with thalassemia. The secondary end points were the level of donor leukocyte chimerism; incidence of acute and chronic graft-vs-host disease; and sickle cell-thalassemia disease-free survival, immunologic recovery, and changes in organ function, assessed by annual brain imaging, pulmonary function, echocardiographic image, and laboratory testing.<br />RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients survived a median 3.4 years (range, 1-8.6), with no nonrelapse mortality. One patient died from intracranial bleeding after relapse. As of October 25, 2013, 26 patients (87%) had long-term stable donor engraftment without acute or chronic graft-vs-host disease. The mean donor T-cell level was 48% (95% CI, 34%-62%); the myeloid chimerism levels, 86% (95% CI, 70%-100%). Fifteen engrafted patients discontinued immunosuppression medication with continued stable donor chimerism and no graft-vs-host disease. The normalized hemoglobin and resolution of hemolysis among engrafted patients were accompanied by stabilization in brain imaging, a reduction of echocardiographic estimates of pulmonary pressure, and allowed for phlebotomy to reduce hepatic iron. The mean annual hospitalization rate was 3.23 (95% CI, 1.83-4.63) the year before, 0.63 (95% CI, 0.26-1.01) the first year after, 0.19 (95% CI, 0-0.45) the second year after, and 0.11 (95% CI, 0.04-0.19) the third year after transplant. For patients taking long-term narcotics, the mean use per week was 639 mg (95% CI, 220-1058) of intravenous morphine-equivalent dose the week of their transplants and 140 mg (95% CI, 56-225) 6 months after transplant. There were 38 serious adverse events: pain and related management, infections, abdominal events, and sirolimus related toxic effects.<br />CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among 30 patients with sickle cell phenotype with or without thalassemia who underwent nonmyeloablative allogeneic HSCT, the rate of stable mixed-donor chimerism was high and allowed for complete replacement with circulating donor red blood cells among engrafted participants. Further accrual and follow-up are required to assess longer-term clinical outcomes, adverse events, and transplant tolerance.<br />TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00061568.","25058217","2014","7"

Radiographic and tomographic analyses were organized.<br />METHODS: From a series of Stickler syndrome patients followed from early life to late childhood. Ten patients (6 boys and four girls of different ethnic origins were consistent with the diagnosis of Stickler syndrome type I ). Phenotypic characterization was the baseline tool applied for all patients and genotypic correlation was performed on four families<br />RESULTS: A constellation of axial abnormalities namely; anterolateral ossification of the anterior longitudinal spinal ligament with subsequent fusion of two cervical vertebrae, early onset Forestier disease (progressive spinal hyperostosis with subsequent vertebral fusion on top of bridging osteophytes and \"Bamboo-like spine\" resembling ankylosing spondylitis) and severe premature spine degeneration were evident. Appendicular abnormalities in connection with generalized epiphyseal dysplasia were the underlying aetiology in patients with Intoeing gait and femoral anteversion, early onset severe osteoarthritis of the weight bearing joint. Remarkable trochleo-patellar dysplasia secondary to severe osteoarthritis causing effectively the development of patellar instability was additional pathology. Mutation of COL2A1 has been confirmed as the causative gene for Stickler syndrome type I CONCLUSION: We concluded that conventional radiographs and the molecular determination of a COL2A1 in patients with (Stickler syndrome type I) are insufficient tools to explain the reasons behind the tremendous magnitude of axial and appendicular skeletal abnormalities. We were able to modify the criteria of the clinical phenotype as designated by Rose et al in accordance with the novel axial and appendicular criteria as emerged from within our current study.","23935403","2013",\N

These are characterized by facial dysmorphia, growth deficits and central nervous system abnormalities. FASDs are the most common preventable cause of intellectual disability in the United States and have high financial costs. Therefore, efforts at prevention are paramount. When an individual with an FASD goes undiagnosed and when appropriate interventions are not instituted, secondary disabilities such as substance abuse, school dropout, and criminal involvement are common with corresponding suffering endured by both the affected individual and the family. The diagnostic process opens up access to existing tools and resources, including the new American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) FASD algorithm for the evaluation of FASDs, the new AAP FASD toolkit and evidence-based interventions specific to FASDs. Pediatric and adolescent clinicians are challenged to participate in the continuum of care from FASD prevention to identification, diagnosis, and management, including provision of supportive services for families in order for clinicians to make a difference in this 100% preventable disorder.","24810409","2014","4"

"1631","Giant mesenteric hemangioma of cavernous and venous mixed type: a rare case report.","BMC surgery","BACKGROUND: Although vascular tumours are one of the most common soft tissue neoplasms, those occurring in the gastrointestinal system are rare and cases involving mesentery are even further rare. Herein, we reported a rare case of giant hemangioma in mesentery of the small bowel.<br />CASE PRESENTATION: A 5-year-old girl was admitted to the emergency room with abdominal pain and vomit for two days. Ultrasonography and computed tomography showed a giant solid-cystic abdominal mass, preferring diagnosis of teratoma. A large neoplasm in the mesentery of the small bowel was found in the surgical exploration, which was then resected with the partial bowel. A brown honeycomb mass in size 16 cmÃ—8 cmÃ—5 cm was observed to adhere to the small bowel, and diagnosed as hemangioma of cavernous and venous mixed type in final pathology.<br />CONCLUSION: The mesenteric hemangioma is extremely rare and the variable imaging tests are non-specific, thus the diagnosis is rarely made before surgery and usually established by histopathological investigation after surgery. So the mesenteric hemangioma is supposed to be differentiated in abdominal mass, either in adults or children. Complete surgical resection is the optimal treatment.","24168418","2013",\N

One of the most important factor in effective head lice eradication is to ensure that infestation is adequately recognized and treated. Our survey investigated the knowledge and practice among primary care Italian pediatricians regarding to the prevention and treatment of head lice.<br />METHODS: The questionnaire was distributed to all the pediatricians registered at the Annual Congress of Practice in Pediatrics held in Florence, Italy, November 11-12, 2011. It includes 10 questions in a multiple choice format, and one answer for each question was provided. The questionnaire was conceived by pediatricians at the Infectious Disease Unit of the Department of Science for the Health of Woman and Child, University of Florence. Questions were designed according to the guidelines by the Italian Pediatric Society (SIP), and international guidelines, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).<br />RESULTS: Overall, 364/600 pediatricians (60.7% of physicians registered to the Congress) returned the questionnaire. The majority of them (232/364; 63,7%) believe that parents consult their primary care pediatrician only after the failure of other \"remedies\". Mostly, they prescribe Malathion (116/364, 31,8%) as first line treatment. Two-hundred-fourty-three (66.7%) of participants consider creams, foams and gels the most effective formulations. Two-hundred-sixty-two of pediatricians interviewed (72.0%) suggest to repeat the treatment after one week, 37/364 (10.2%) after two weeks. The majority of the pediatricians interviewed reported that recurrences occur in less than 30% of cases (279/364; 76,6%). In their own opinion, most of recurrences are the consequence of a reinfestation in the community (259/264; 77%). Three-hundred-thirty-four (91.7%) of them have never prescribed oral therapy for the treatment of head lice. Finally, 289/364 (79.4%) pediatricians believe that no product is effective for prevention.<br />CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that investigates the clinical practice of family pediatricians about the management and treatment of head lice globally, the Italian pediatricians surveyed proved to be quite informed on the head lice management. However, even in a country where pediatric assistance is free for everybody, a considerable proportion of parents do not seek advice to their own family pediatrician. Therefore, educations of parents, other than continuous updating of pediatricians, may contribute to a better management of head lice in the community.","24090319","2013",\N
"1636","Loss of SMAD4 protein expression is associated with high tumor grade and poor prognosis in disseminated appendiceal mucinous neoplasms.","The American journal of surgical pathology","The distinction between low-grade and high-grade disseminated appendiceal mucinous neoplasms is of critical importance in assessing prognosis and guiding patient therapy. SMAD4 encodes a protein that is a central component of the TGFÎ² signal transduction pathway, and loss of SMAD4 expression has been associated with poor prognosis in carcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract. We reviewed the clinicopathologic and molecular features of 109 disseminated appendiceal mucinous neoplasms identified over an 8-year period at our institution in an attempt to: (1) correlate SMAD4 immunohistochemical expression with tumor grade; and (2) assess the prognostic significance of SMAD4 expression in predicting overall survival. Compared with tumors demonstrating preserved SMAD4 expression, tumors with loss of SMAD4 expression more frequently exhibited high cytologic grade (85% vs. 50%, P=0.035), high cellularity (100% vs. 45%, P<0.001), and destructive invasion (100% vs. 55%, P=0.001). SMAD4 expression significantly correlated with overall tumor grade (P=0.003): all 13 tumors with loss of SMAD4 expression were high grade, whereas all 42 low-grade tumors displayed preserved SMAD4 expression. A significantly higher proportion of tumors with loss of SMAD4 immunohistochemical expression demonstrated loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 18q (38%) compared with tumors with preserved SMAD4 expression (11%) (P=0.049), suggesting that loss of SMAD4 expression is due to genomic deletion in a high proportion of cases. Patients with SMAD4-negative tumors had significantly worse overall survival in comparison with patients with preserved SMAD4 expression (log rank P=0.023). However, our multivariable analysis found that SMAD4 expression was not independent of overall tumor grade in predicting overall survival. Our results indicate that loss of SMAD4 immunohistochemical expression is associated with loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 18q and is always associated with aggressive histologic features in disseminated appendiceal mucinous neoplasms. SMAD4 immunohistochemistry may be a useful ancillary study in select cases of disseminated appendiceal neoplasia, in which the distinction between low-grade and high-grade tumors is difficult.","24618609","2014","5"
"1637","Predictors of depression and anxiety in community dwelling stroke survivors: a cohort study.","Disability and rehabilitation","PURPOSE: Few longitudinal studies explore post-stroke patterns of psychological morbidity and factors contributing to their change over time. We aimed to explore predictors of post-stroke depression (PSD) and post-stroke anxiety over a 12-month period.<br />METHODS: A prospective cohort study. Consecutively recruited stroke patients (n=134) participated in face-to-face interviews at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Primary outcome measures were depression and anxiety (measured via Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Independent variables included disability (Modified Rankin Scale), Quality-of-life (Assessment Quality-of-life), social support (Multi-dimensional Scale Perceived Social Support) and community participation (Adelaide Activities Profile (AAP)). Secondary outcomes were predictors of resolution and development of PSD and anxiety.<br />RESULTS: Anxiety (47%) was more common than depression (22%) at baseline. Anxiety (but not depression) scores improved over time. Anxiety post-stroke was positively associated with baseline PSD (p<0.0001), baseline anxiety (p<0.0001) and less disability (p=0.042). PSD was associated with baseline anxiety (p<0.0001), baseline depression (p=0.0057), low social support (p=0.0161) and low community participation (p<0.0001). The only baseline factor predicting the resolution of PSD (if depressed at baseline) was increased social support (p=0.0421). Factors that predicted the onset of depression (if not depressed at baseline) were low community participation (p=0.0015) and higher disability (p=0.0057).<br />CONCLUSION: While more common than depression immediately post-stroke, anxiety attenuates while the burden of depression persists over 12 months. Clinical programs should assess anxiety and depression, provide treatment pathways for those identified, and address modifiable risk factors, especially social support and social engagement. Implications for Rehabilitation Psychological distress post stroke is persisting. Multi-disciplinary teams that establish goals with patients promoting social and community engagement could assist in managing psychological morbidity. A shift towards promoting longer-term monitoring and management of stroke survivors must be undertaken, and should consider the factors that support and hinder psychological morbidity.","24499259","2014",\N

Postoperative pain is a concern and administration of systemic analgesic may be difficult because of underlying co-morbidities and variable responses of the graft. The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is one of the different approaches for postoperative pain relief following abdominal surgeries. We evaluated analgesic efficacy of TAP block on early postoperative pain by numeric rating scale (NRS) and morphine consumption during the first 24 hours after kidney transplantation.<br />METHODS: Forty-four patients, scheduled as kidney recipients were randomized into two equal groups and were anesthetized with the same technique. After the induction of anesthesia, 15â€‰mL of 0.25% Bupivacaine plus 5â€‰Î¼/ml epinephrine or saline was deposited into the transversus abdominis neuro-fascial plane on the side of surgery by ultrasound guide. Each patient was assessed by a blinded investigator using NRS at 1st, 4th, 8th, 12th, and 24th hour postoperatively.<br />RESULTS: Demographic data were not significantly different between the study groups. There was significant difference in median of NRS score measured at all time points in the study groups (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). The 24-hour morphine consumption (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SD) was 10.8â€‰Â±â€‰9.5â€‰mg in bupivacaine group compared with 41.2â€‰Â±â€‰3.8â€‰mg in the saline group (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.001). There was statistically significant reduction in intraoperative fentanyl consumption in the TAP group 120â€‰Â±â€‰20â€‰Î¼g compared to the control group 358â€‰Â±â€‰24â€‰Î¼g (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.001). In study group 4 patients and in control group 90 patients received morphine titration for pain relief (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.03). There was no complication in the study groups related to nerve block. Only two patients in saline group had nausea (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.07). None of our patients received any other oral or IV rescue medication.<br />CONCLUSION: Ultrasound TAP block can reduce postrenal transplantation pain and the amount of opioids consumption intraoperatively and during the first 24 hours after surgery in kidney recipients.","24330449","2014","3"

"1643","Ileal duplication mimicking intestinal intussusception: a congenital condition rarely reported in adult.","World journal of gastroenterology : WJG","Intestinal duplication is an uncommon congenital condition in young adults. A 25-year-old man complained of chronic, intermittent abdominal pain for 3 years following previous appendectomy for the treatment of suspected appendicitis. Abdominal discomfort and pain, suggestive of intestinal obstruction, recurred after operation. A tubular mass was palpable in the right lower quadrant. Computed tomography enterography scan identified suspicious intestinal intussusception, while Tc-99m pertechnetate scintigraphy revealed a cluster of strip-like abnormal radioactivity in the right lower quadrant. On exploratory laparotomy, a tubular-shaped ileal duplication cyst was found arising from the mesenteric margin of the native ileal segment located 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. Ileectomy was performed along with the removal of the duplication disease, and the end-to-end anastomosis was done to restore the gastrointestinal tract continuity. Pathological examination showed ileal duplication with ectopic gastric mucosa. The patient experienced an eventless postoperative recovery and remained asymptomatic within 2 years of postoperative follow-up.","24151372","2013","10"

LSD is characterised by high fever, formation of circumscribed skin lesions and ulcerative lesions on the mucous membranes of the mouth, respiratory and digestive tracts. It is an economically important disease due to the permanent damage to hides, the reduction in productivity and trade restrictions imposed on affected areas. Transmission has been associated with blood-feeding insects such as stable flies (Stomoxysis calcitrans) and mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti). Mechanical (intrastadial) and transstadial transmission by Amblyomma hebraeum and Rhipicephalus appendiculatus as well as transovarial transmission by R. decoloratus have been reported. In this study transovarial passage of LSDV to larvae and subsequent transmission to recipient animals were demonstrated. The finding of transovarial passage of LSDV in female ticks shows the potential for A. hebraeum, R. appendiculatus and R. decoloratus to be reservoir hosts for LSDV.","23975564","2014","1"

A further 64 hip fracture patients also recruited in the early phase of recovery were used in the cross-validation of the regression models (CV group). Multiple linear regression analyses were undertaken in the MD group to identify the best performing prediction models. The linear coefficient of determination (R(2)) in addition to the standard error of the estimate (SEE) were calculated to determine the best performing model. Agreement between estimated ASM and ASMDEXA in the CV group was assessed using paired t-tests with the 95% limits of agreement (LOA) assessed using Bland-Altman analyses.<br />RESULTS: the mean age of all the participants was 82.1 Â± 7.3 years. The best two prediction models are presented as follows: ASMPRED-EQUATION_1: 22.28 - (0.069 * age) + (0.407 * weight) - (0.807 * BMI) - (0.222 * MAC) (adjusted R(2): 0.76; SEE: 1.80 kg); ASMPRED-EQUATION_2: 16.77 - (0.036 * age) + (0.385 * weight) - (0.873 * BMI) (adjusted R(2): 0.73; SEE: 1.90 kg). The mean bias from the CV group between ASMDEXA and the predictive equations is as follows: ASMDEXA - ASMPRED-EQUATION_1: 0.29 Â± 2.6 kg (LOA: -4.80, 5.40 kg); ASMDEXA - ASMPRED-EQUATION_2: 0.13 Â± 2.5 kg (LOA: -4.77, 5.0 kg). No significant difference was observed between measured ASMDEXA and estimated ASM (ASMDEXA: 16.4 Â± 3.9 kg; ASMPRED-EQUATION_1: 16.7 Â± 3.2 kg (P = 0.379); ASMPRED-EQUATION_2: 16.6 Â± 3.2 kg (P = 0.670)).<br />CONCLUSIONS: we have developed and cross-validated novel anthropometric prediction equations against DEXA for the estimate of ASM designed for application in older orthopaedic patients. Our equation may be of use as an alternative to DEXA in the diagnosis of skeletal muscle wasting syndromes. Further validation studies are required to determine the clinical utility of our equation across other settings, including hip fracture patients admitted from residential care, and also with a longer-term follow-up.","25049262","2014","11"

This study sought to understand parents' perspectives on these issues and determine their experiences and knowledge related to genetic testing for Batten disease - a set of inherited neurodegenerative diseases of childhood onset for which no disease modifying therapies yet exist.<br />METHODS: Parents of children with Batten disease completed a survey of their knowledge of genetics, experience with genetic testing, and opinions regarding GTIC.<br />RESULTS: 54% had sought genetic testing for non-affected family members, including predictive diagnosis of healthy, at-risk children. Participation in any genetic counseling was associated with greater knowledge on questions about genetics. The majority of parents felt it was better to know ahead of time that a child would develop Batten disease, believed that this knowledge would not alter how they related to their child, and that parents should have the final say in deciding whether to obtain GTIC.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Parents of children with an inherited disease are knowledgeable about genetics and wish to establish predictive or carrier status of at-risk children.","24246680","2014","2"

Few clinical studies report that psychological and pharmacological interventions can significantly reduce the severity of IGD symptomatology. The aim of this review was to assess current knowledge of the short- and long-term benefits of IGD interventions. This review presents a systematic evaluation of definitions of diagnosis and treatment outcomes employed in IGD treatment studies, including an assessment of goodness of fit with the DSM-5 classification.<br />METHOD: A computer database search of Academic Search Premier, PubMed, PsychINFO, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and Google Scholar was conducted to identify all available research evidence on Internet gaming disorder treatment (N = 8 studies). Diagnostic and treatment outcome parameters were systematically evaluated.<br />RESULTS: Several weaknesses of IGD treatment literature were identified. Only 2 treatment studies have employed an equivalent method of diagnosis for IGD. Studies have not assessed formative change in diagnostic status at posttreatment or follow-up. Duration of follow-up has been inadequate to assess relapse and remission. Posttreatment assessment has been predominantly limited to IGD symptomatology, comorbidity, and frequency of gaming behavior.<br />CONCLUSION: Currently, there is insufficient evidence to warrant suggestion that trialled IGD interventions confer a long-term therapeutic benefit. Several improvements to study design and reporting are proposed to guide future studies of IGD.","24752874","2014","10"

A case report.","Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine","We present a case of a 58-year-old menopausal woman referred to our hospital for the presence of large pelvic masses diagnosed by clinical examination and pelvic ultrasound. MRI examination showed voluminous bilateral capsulated multilocular ovarian cysts slightly hyperintense on T1-weighted images with thick septa and small papillary projections. CT scan confirmed the MRI findings. Among the ovarian tumor markers analyzed (CA125, HE4, and CA72.4), only Ca125 was slightly increased (48 U/ml). These data were suggestive of mucinous ovarian tumor. The patient underwent total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, appendectomy, and multiple peritoneal biopsies. Pathological examination revealed bilateral borderline mucinous ovarian tumor with superficial atypical implants. Nine months later, the patient complained of left coxofemoral pain and underwent a PET/TC total body that suggested pubic bone metastases. Ovarian tumor markers were analyzed, and a second PET/TC was performed. CA125 was 252 U/ml, HE4 62 pM/L, and CA72.4 > 100 U/Ml. PET/TC was suggestive of peritoneal carcinosis. The patient was readmitted to the hospital. Clinical examination revealed small vaginal nodules. All nodules were excised. Microscopic analysis of all specimens revealed metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma of intestinal type.The case shows that even a slight CA125 increase in the presence of a borderline ovarian tumor should not be overlooked since it can be indicative of a progressive disease. This case also highlights its additional diagnostic value when serum CA125 analysis is used in conjunction with MRI and CT imaging for the prognosis of mucinous borderline ovarian tumors (mBOTs).","24740561","2014","7"

A 70-year-old man was hospitalized for abdominal pain and diarrhea. Abdominal computed tomography demonstrated a variant common hepatic artery arising from the SMA and multiple thromboembolic occlusions of visceral arteries, including the SMA and celiac artery. Laboratory data showed markedly elevated hepatic enzymes, which increased after admission despite the initiation of systemic anticoagulant and thrombolytic therapy. The patient was successfully treated by endovascular recanalization of the SMA occlusion via transcatheter embolus aspiration, thrombolysis, balloon angioplasty, and stent placement. Severe ischemic liver injury may occur in the setting of synchronous embolism of the SMA and celiac artery, and these phenomena may have a critical impact on the choice of treatment strategies and prognosis.

Although it represents a recognized serious condition that should not be overlooked, it is not often considered by surgeons within the differential diagnoses faced with a patient presenting right iliac fossa abdominal pain, particularly those who present a previous history of appendectomy.<br />MATERIAL OF STUDY: A comprehensive review of English literature was performed and 87 cases of stump appendicitis were identified. Each case was charted based on 10 variables and data were analyzed. One original case of stump appendicitis after open appendectomy treated at our institution is also described and taken as a model.<br />DISCUSSION: Several factors may contribute to the etiology of stump appendicitis, mainly related to the length of the residual tissue after appendectomy. A delay in diagnosis, possibly misled by a previous history of appendectomy, represents a risk of complications and possible stump perforation. The imaging studies, especially CT scan, seem to be helpful tools in getting the earliest possible diagnosis.<br />CONCLUSION: Surgeons should be aware of the occurrence of this rare but dangerous entity, in order to avoid a delay in diagnosis and in the appropriate therapeutic choice. We want to emphasize also the technical recommendations to be respected in course of appendectomy.<br />KEY WORDS: Appendectomy, Appendicular residue, Diagnosis, Stump appendicitis.","25027013","2014",\N

The deletion variant allele of the NFKB1 - 94ins/delATTG promoter polymorphism leads to lower transcript levels of the p50 subunit, and the variant allele has been associated with the risk of several inflammatory diseases as well as coronary heart disease where inflammation is important in the pathogenesis. The objective of this study was to explore the potential interaction between the NFKB1-94ins/delATTG promoter polymorphism and general, abdominal, and gluteofemoral obesity in relation to the risk of incident acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in three large independent cohorts.<br />METHODS AND RESULTS: The analyses were conducted in the Danish prospective study Diet, Cancer and Health and the two US based cohorts; Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study. We conducted sex stratified analyses that included 1202 male and 708 female cases of incident ACS. We observed a positive association for general and abdominal obesity with risk of incident ACS, independent of genotype in both genders. Gluteofemoral obesity was negatively associated with ACS risk in women independent of genotype, whereas there was no clear association for men. We calculated the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) and observed a statistically significant excess risk among men jointly exposed to general or abdominal obesity and the variant allele of the NFKB1-94ATTG polymorphism, whereas there was a tendency towards sub-additivity for gluteofemoral obesity. The excess risks in all analyses were, however, small and could not clearly be demonstrated in women.<br />CONCLUSION: The variant allele of the NFKB1-94ins/delATTG promoter polymorphism did not substantially modify the association between obesity and incident ACS.","23671649","2013",\N

A retrospective review was conducted of patients younger than age 17 years treated for PA over a 12.5-year period at a tertiary medical center. Patient characteristics, preoperative indices, and postoperative outcomes were analyzed for patients undergoing LA and OA. Of 289 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 86 had LA (29.8%) and 203 OA (70.2%), the two groups having equivalent patient demographics and preoperative indices. Inpatient costs were not significantly different between LA and OA. LA had a lower rate of wound infection (1.2 vs. 8.9%, P = 0.017), total parenteral nutrition use (23.3 vs. 50.7%, P < 0.0001), and length of stay (5.56 Â± 2.38 days vs. 7.25 Â± 3.77 days, P = 0.0001). There was no significant difference in the rate of postoperative organ space abscess, surgical re-exploration, or rehospitalization. In children with PA, LA had fewer surgical site infections and shorter lengths of hospital stay compared with OA without an increase in inpatient costs.","24069976","2013","9"

The gastrointestinal (GI) anthrax develops after eating contaminated meat. Thus, in this paper were report 5 cases of intestinal anthrax.<br />CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case series of intestinal anthrax, with history of consumption of raw or poorly cooked liver of sheep. One patient was female and 4 were males with the age range between 17 and 26 years. All patients were admitted with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Examination revealed abdominal distention on the right lower quadrant or diffuse tenderness. Laboratory examination in all patients showed leukocytosis with polymorphonuclear of >80%. Because of the unclear and questionable diagnosis, exploratory laparotomy was performed on several patients, invariably showing an abundant yellowish and thick ascitic fluid, soft hypertrophied mesenteric lymph nodes (3-5 cm) mostly in the ileocecal region, and substantial edema involving one segment of small bowel, cecum or ascending colon. Anthrax was diagnosed on the epidemiologic basis (ingestion history of half cooked liver of sheep) or microbiologic (microscopy with bacterial culture) and pathologic testing (post surgery in four patients or autopsy in one patient). With appropriate treatment, 4 survived and one patient died.<br />CONCLUSION: Gastrointestinal anthrax is characterized by rapid onset, fever, ascitis and septicemia. The symptoms can mimic those seen in an acute surgical abdomen. Rapid diagnosis and prompt initiation of antibiotic therapy and then exploratory laparotomy (right hemicolectomy) are keys to survival.","24009958","2013",\N

Sarcopenia was defined as an appendicular fat-free mass (AFFM) divided by height squared â‰¤5.45 kg/m(2) while SO was classified based on the residuals of a regression. Waist circumference (WC) and arterial blood pressure were also measured. Student's t-tests and correlations were used for analyses. Prevalence of sarcopenia and SO were respectively 16.8 and 21.5%. WC was significantly correlated with all the examined risk factors. AFFM relative to height squared was positively correlated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), CRP, insulinaemia, HOMA score, and those classified as sarcopenic presented lower HOMA score when compared to nonsarcopenic. Regarding SO, although volunteers classified presented significantly higher fat mass (FM) and lower AFFM, it was not observed association with the examined risk factors. These findings support the association between WC and cardiometabolic risk factors in older women. In contrast, the approaches used to define sarcopenia and SO are not associated with cardiometabolic impairments.","24766993",\N,\N

This study aims to: 1) identify the diversity of species of wild orchids in trade in Nepal; 2) study the chain of commercialization from collector to client and/or export; 3) map traditional knowledge and medicinal use of orchids; and 4) integrate the collected data to propose a more sustainable approach to orchid conservation in Nepal.<br />METHODS: Trade, species diversity, and traditional use of wild-harvested orchids were documented during field surveys of markets and through interviews. Trade volumes and approximate income were estimated based on surveys and current market prices. Orchid material samples were identified to species level using a combination of morphology and DNA barcoding.<br />RESULTS: Orchid trade is a long tradition, and illegal export to China, India and Hong Kong is rife. Estimates show that 9.4 tons of wild orchids were illegally traded from the study sites during 2008/2009. A total of 60 species of wild orchids were reported to be used in traditional medicinal practices to cure at least 38 different ailments, including energizers, aphrodisiacs and treatments of burnt skin, fractured or dislocated bones, headaches, fever and wounds. DNA barcoding successfully identified orchid material to species level that remained sterile after culturing.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Collection of wild orchids was found to be widespread in Nepal, but illegal trade is threatening many species in the wild. Establishment of small-scale sustainable orchid breeding enterprises could be a valuable alternative for the production of medicinal orchids for local communities. Critically endangered species should be placed on CITES Appendix I to provide extra protection to those species.

Several studies have demonstrated that individuals who have undergone surgery are at a greater risk of having incomplete FS. This study explored predictors of incomplete FS and reduced polyp detection rates for participants who had undergone abdominal or pelvic surgery.<br />METHODS: From January 2009 to December 2009, individuals participating in health examinations and who had undergone abdominal or pelvic surgery were invited to participate in this investigation. Four experienced gastroenterologists performed examinations using a 60-cm Olympus video sigmoidoscope. Factors associated with incomplete FS insertions and reduced polyp detection rates were analyzed using logistic regression models.<br />RESULTS: Overall, 106 eligible individuals were analyzed, and 45 (42%) incomplete FS insertions were reviewed. Fifty participants (47%) had undergone pelvic surgery, and the other 56 (53%) had undergone abdominal surgery. Pelvic surgeries were cesarean section (25%) and hysterectomy (15%); appendectomy (36%) was the most common abdominal surgery. The main pathological FS findings were hemorrhoids (54%) and adenomatous polyps (18%). Multivariate analysis indicated that only prior pelvic surgery [odds ratio (OR), 3.54; pÂ =Â 0.01] was an independent risk factor for incomplete FS insertion. Incomplete examinations were inversely related to adenomatous polyp detection rates (OR, 0.23; pÂ =Â 0.03).<br />CONCLUSION: Prior pelvic surgery, particularly cesarean section and hysterectomy, is an independent factor for incomplete FS insertion in a selected adult population. In addition, incomplete FS can increase the risk of missing polyps, particularly in individuals who underwent pelvic surgery.","24388006","2014","3"

Low-level Pb was selected for evaluation by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) because of (1) the availability of a large number of epidemiological studies of Pb, (2) a nomination by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health for an assessment of Pb at lower levels of exposure, and (3) public concern for effects of Pb in children and adults. This evaluation summarizes the evidence in humans and presents conclusions on health effects in children and adults associated with low-level Pb exposure as indicated by less than 10 micrograms of Pb per deciliter of blood (< 10 microg/dL). The assessment focuses on epidemiological evidence at blood Pb levels < 10 microg/dL and < 5 microg/dL because health effects at higher blood Pb levels are well established.

The results of this evaluation are published in the NTP Monograph on Health Effects of Low-Level Lead. The document and appendices are available at http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/go/evals. This document provides background on Pb exposure and includes a review of the primary epidemiological literature for evidence that low-level Pb is associated with neurological, immunological, cardiovascular, renal, and/or reproductive and developmental effects. The NTP Monograph presents specific conclusions for each health effect area. Overall, the NTP concludes that there is sufficient evidence that blood Pb levels < 10 microg/dL and < 5 microg/dL are associated with adverse health effects in children and adults. This conclusion was based on a review of the primary epidemiological literature, scientific input from technical advisors that reviewed pre-public release drafts of each chapter summarizing the evidence for specific health effects associated with low-level Pb, public comments received during the course of the evaluation, and comments from an expert panel of ad hoc reviewers during a public meeting to review the Draft NTP Monograph on November 17-18, 2011 (http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/go/37090.","23964424","2012","6"

"1670","Patient perspectives on postoperative visits after common general operative procedures.","Surgery","BACKGROUND: Many postoperative concerns after common general operative procedures may be addressed over the phone, thereby saving time and resources for both the patient and surgeon.<br />METHODS: Over a 6-month time period, patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis, and inguinal or umbilical hernia repair were mailed an anonymous survey. The primary outcome measure was whether or not patients felt their concerns could have been addressed adequately over the phone in place of an office visit.<br />RESULTS: A total of 1,406 surveys were mailed with 339 responses (24%: 174 laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 83 inguinal hernia, 41 appendectomy, and 41 umbilical hernia). One hundred twelve (33%) felt their concerns could have been addressed adequately over the phone without an office visit. Patients who spent less time with their doctor at the appointment favored telephone follow-up (P < .001). Patients undergoing inguinal hernia were less interested in telephone follow-up compared with laparoscopic cholecystectomy (15% vs 41%; P < .001), appendectomy (15% vs 34%; P = .018), and umbilical hernia (15% vs 37%; P = .010). Of 66 patients (20%) with self-reported complications, 44% sought care from a healthcare provider other than their primary surgeon.<br />CONCLUSION: These observations are important for healthcare organizations seeking to maximize surgeon efficiency while improving patient satisfaction.","24008090","2013","10"
"1671","Pilot study of intraperitoneal administration of triamcinolone acetonide for cancerous ascites in patients with end-stage gynecological cancer.","International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society","OBJECTIVE: Patients with end-stage cancer have poorly controlled ascites retention resulting due to cancerous peritonitis. We intraperitoneally administered triamcinolone acetonide (TA) to patients with end-stage gynecological cancer as a pilot study, and our treatment results are reported herein.<br />PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 26 patients with end-stage gynecological cancer requiring frequent abdominal paracentesis for ascites drainage between April 2010 and September 2012. The volume of ascites drainage was 2000 to 3000 mL per drainage session, and TA at 10 mg/kg was intraperitoneally administered after drainage. We compared abdominal paracentesis intervals, performance status (PS), total protein level, albumin level, white blood cell count, changes in C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and adverse events before and after TA use.<br />RESULTS: Triamcinolone acetonide was administered to 26 patients for a total of 59 times. The abdominal paracentesis intervals, PS, and mean (SD) of C-reactive protein before and after TA use were 13.2 (12.6) days and 21.9 (23.6) days (P = 0.0117), 2.4 (0.7) and 1.6 (1.1) (P < 0.0001), and 7.5 (5.2) mg/dL and 5.5 (5.0) mg/dL (P = 0.007), respectively. With regard to adverse events, abdominal pain of grade 2 was observed once (1.7%), but there were no other acute adverse events. Four subjects (15.4%) had intestinal perforation.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Intraperitoneal administration of TA after drainage was considered to be a useful treatment, as it seems to extend paracentesis intervals and improve PS while maintaining quality of life for end-stage gynecological cancer patients with massive ascites.","24978712","2014","7"

Cases diagnosed as spontaneous intramural hematoma have been assessed in our clinic.<br />METHODS: The cases, which were diagnosed as spontaneous intramural hematoma in the gastrointestinal tract (SIHGT) following anamnesis, physical examination, biochemical, radiological and endoscopic findings from July 2008 to July 2012, have been assessed retrospectively.<br />RESULTS: Seven out of 13 cases were women and the mean age was 65.1 years (34 to 82 years). The most frequent complaint on admission was abdominal pain. The most frequent location of SIHGT was the ileum (n = 8). Oral anticoagulant use was the most common cause of etiology (n = 12). In 10 cases, International normalized ratio values were higher than treatment range (2 to 3, where mechanical valve replacement was 2.5 to 3.5) and mean value was 7.6 (1.70 to 23.13). While 12 cases were discharged without problems with medical treatment, one case with acute myeloid leukemia died in the intensive care unit following cerebrovascular attack.<br />CONCLUSION: Spontaneus bleeding and hematomas that may arise in connection with bleeding diathesis may be fatal in cases with long-term oral anticoagulant treatment and insufficient follow-up. In management of these cases, it may be necessary to arrange conservative follow up and/or initialize low molecular weight heparin, and administer vitamin K as well as replace blood products and coagulation factors when indicated.","23908961","2013","8"

Sarcopenia was defined using 4 different sex-specific definitions. Multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses adjusted for disease activity, disease duration, physical activity, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide seropositivity, fat mass index, and glucocorticoid use.<br />RESULTS: While there were significant differences between the 2 cohorts, ALM index Z scores were significantly lower in men compared to women in both (SF: -1.43 versus -0.43, P < 0.0001; PA: -0.83 versus -0.06, P = 0.03). Observed sex differences were significant after adjustment in multivariable analyses within both cohorts. Odds of sarcopenia were 3 to 8 times greater in men in the SF cohort. Men in the PA cohort also had a higher, but nonsignificant, risk of sarcopenia.<br />CONCLUSION: RA is associated with significant LBM deficits, with greater deficits observed in men. Future study may help elucidate the mechanisms driving greater deficits among men.","25048740","2015","1"

Generalized structural equation models were built to predict progression to severe disease.<br />RESULTS: A total of 499 laboratory confirmed dengue patients were recruited in the Prospective Adult Dengue Study at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore. We found no statistically significant differences between pain score with age, gender, ethnicity or the presence of co-morbidity. Pain score was not predictive of dengue severity but highly correlated to patients' day of illness. Prevalence of abdominal pain in our cohort was 19%. There was no difference in abdominal pain score between grades of dengue severity.<br />CONCLUSION: Dengue is a painful disease. Patients suffer more pain at the earlier phase of illness. However, pain score cannot be used to predict a patient's progression to severe disease.","24788828","2014",\N

A 26-year-old woman presented with acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea a few days after beginning meloxicam treatment. Endoscopic examination of the colon showed erythematous and ulcerative lesions involving 15 cm of the left colon. No aetiology has been found for colitis. Diarrhea disappeared 1 week after meloxicam was stopped. Total colonoscopy 3 months and 2 years later was normal. The role of meloxicam in the etiology of colitis was considered plausible.

It usually leads to the formation of a local abscess. In some rare cases, the inflammatory process may spread towards extra-abdominal sites like the anterior or posterior abdominal wall or the thigh and form an abscess in these sites. We present the case of a 73-year-old man with a history of pain at the lower left quadrant of the abdomen for 20 days and a visible mass in this site. Ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed this mass to be an abscess of the abdominal wall which had been formed by the spread of ruptured sigmoid diverticulitis by continuity of tissue through the lower left abdominal wall. Local drainage of the abscess was performed and the patient was discharged after alleviation of symptoms and an uneventful course. We also discuss causes of abdominal wall abscesses along with the possible pathways by which an intra-abdominal abscess could spread outside the abdominal cavity.","24386584","2013",\N

Our patient presented with temporary loss of consciousness and acute abdominal pain. Hemorrhagic shock and anemia were diagnosed based on a physical examination and laboratory investigations, and rapid infusion of Ringer's lactate solution was initiated. Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography revealed hemorrhagic ascites with effusion of radiopaque dye into his pelvic cavity. A ruptured aneurysm was suspected in his superior rectal artery and selective angiography of the inferior mesenteric artery confirmed this diagnosis. Transcatheter arterial embolization was successfully performed and our patient was discharged 15 days after admission, with good recovery of his hemoglobin level, and no further hemorrhage or abdominal pain.<br />CONCLUSION: This case of spontaneous rupture of a dissecting aneurysm in the peripheral blood supply strongly suggests the involvement of multiple blood vessel abnormalities in neurofibromatosis type 1. Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 should undergo regular review given their overall health and the risk of fatality in vasculopathy associated with this disease.","24200148","2013",\N

"1682","Adult Hirschsprung's disease: report of four cases.","International journal of clinical and experimental pathology","Adult Hirschsprung's disease (HD) is a rare motor disorder of the gut that is frequently misdiagnosed as refractory constipation. The primary pathogenic defect in adult HD is identical to that seen in infancy or childhood, and is characterized by the total absence of intramural ganglion cells of the submucosal (Meissner) and myenteric (Auerbach) neural plexuses in the affected segment of the bowel. Ninety-four percent of HD cases are diagnosed before the patient reaches 5 years of age, however, on rare occasion, mild cases of HD may go undiagnosed until he or she reaches adulthood. In this study, we describe four cases of adult HD with a history of longstanding recurrent constipation, relieved by laxatives, and presenting to the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery with progressive abdominal distention, colicky pain or acute intestinal obstruction. Barium enema or computed tomography revealed a grossly distended proximal large colon with fecal retention. Intraoperative frozen section biopsy was performed in all cases and showed aganglionosis of the stenotic segment and a normal distal rectum. In all cases, patient symptoms were completely resolved and there were no complications arising immediately post-surgery or at one-year follow-up. Adult HD should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cases where adult patients present with chronic constipation or even acute intestinal obstruction. The modified one-stage Martin-Duhamel or Rehbein's procedure is a feasible surgical option for treating cases of adult HD involving a segment or the entire bowel.","23923081","2013",\N
"1683","Bacterial species-specific hospital mortality rate for intra-abdominal infections.","Surgical infections","BACKGROUND: Intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are a major cause of morbidity and death. We hypothesized that the involvement of specific organisms would predict death independently.<br />PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients with IAIs treated at an academic tertiary-care facility over eight years (June 1999-June 2007) were included. The data collected were demographics, co-morbidities, source of infection, intra-abdominal culture results, type of infection (community-acquired vs. nosocomial), type of intervention (operative vs. percutaneous drainage), and outcome. The Charlson Comorbidity Index and multiple organ dysfunction score (MODS) were used in the analysis.<br />RESULTS: A total of 389 patients were admitted for 452 infection episodes (IEs) during the study period. None of the 129 patients with appendiceal-related infections died, and these patients were excluded from further analysis. Thus, 323 non-appendiceal IEs were evaluated. The overall mortality rate was 8.7%. The mean age of the patients was 54 y, and 50% of them were male. Intra-abdominal cultures were obtained from 303 IEs (93.8%). The most common cause of IAI was post-operative infection (44%). There were 49 distinct species isolated. The most common were Enterococcus (105), Escherichia coli (75), Streptococcus (62), Staphylococcus (51), and Bacteroides (46). Bivariable analysis revealed multiple risk factors associated with death. Logistic regression demonstrated that independent risk factors for death were age â‰¥65 years (odds ratio [OR] 3.92), cardiac event (OR=8.17), catheter-related blood stream infection (OR=6.16), and growth of Clostridium (OR=13.03). The growth of Streptococcus was predictive of survival. The C statistic was 0.89.<br />CONCLUSIONS: In addition to age and intrinsic patient factors, the presence of specific bacterial organisms independently predicts death in patients with non-appendiceal IAI.","24801801","2014","6"

We examined 116 cases of cerebral infarction using transcranial Doppler ultrasound in order to exclude cerebrovascular stenosis. Transesophageal echocardiography and color Doppler ultrasound were used to detect aortic atherosclerotic plaques (AAPs) and carotid atherosclerotic plaques (CAPs). AAPs were detected in a total of 70 of the 116 cases (60.3%), including 56 with moderate/severe atherosclerotic changes (48.3%). The difference in the incidence of various types of infarction between APP severity levels was significant (P<0.01). Of the 116 cases, 64 had CAPs (55.2%), including 46 with unstable plaque (39.7%). The difference in the incidence of various types of infarction between CAP stability levels was significant (P<0.01). The results indicate that moderate/severe AAP and unstable CAP are significant causes of embolic infarction without stenosis in the internal carotid arteries.","24137198","2013","8"

"1686","The short appendix vermiformis as a risk factor for colorectal cancer.","Clinical anatomy (New York, N.Y.)","The human appendix vermiformis is regarded as an evolutionarily vestigial organ, although it has presumptive immune system functions and appears to support beneficial bacterial gut flora, both of which could influence cancer progression. A review of the comparative anatomy of the mammalian appendix reveals a significantly longer appendix in herbivores than in carnivorous animals. The lengthier appendix vermiformis in herbivores has been associated with the presence of cellulose-digesting bacteria that colonize the structure. In light of recent studies that have reported the digestion of small amounts of cellulose in humans and the preventive effects of a vegetarian diet on colon cancer, we conducted a retrospective study of abdominal CT scans of 60 colon cancer patients and 60 healthy people to investigate a possible relationship between colon cancer and appendix vermiformis length. The mean length of the appendix in cancer patients [65.178 mm Â± 13.46 (SD)] was shorter than that in the healthy control group [101.99 mm Â± 16.58 (SD)] and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Statistical analysis demonstrated that the ages of the cancer patient group and the control group did not differ significantly (P = 0.534). The results of the present study indicate that the appendix is not merely a vestigial structure or regressed lymphoid tissue, but rather an organ that could be critical in the development of colon cancer, whether as a result of congenital or acquired appendicular factors.","24497155","2014","4"
"1687","The burden of diverticular disease on patients and healthcare systems.","Gastroenterology & hepatology","Diverticulitis is a debilitating complication of diverticular disease that affects approximately 2.5 million individuals in the United States. Compared to many other gastrointestinal conditions, diverticular disease is poorly understood in terms of its burden on patients and healthcare systems. This review examines the existing literature and discusses the current knowledge of the burden of diverticular disease. Literature confirmed that bothersome symptoms (such as abdominal pain and bloating) and potentially serious, disease-related complications (such as diverticulitis and diverticular bleeding) place a significant burden on patients. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and surgery are the generally accepted mainstays of treatment for acute complications of diverticular disease. Despite these options, patients frequently experience substantially reduced quality of life (particularly in terms of social and emotional functioning) and increased mortality (predominantly due to disease-related complications) compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, diverticular disease accounted for 254,179 inpatient discharges and 1,493,865 outpatient clinic visits in the United States in 2002, at an estimated cost per hospitalization of $9,742-$11,729. Enhancing the quality of life of patients with diverticular disease and reducing disease exacerbations and complications will substantially benefit patients and healthcare systems. However, long-established treatment algorithms fall short of these therapeutic goals. Research into new treatment options for patients with diverticular disease should therefore be pursued.","24707230","2013","1"
"1688","Ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease? Pitfalls and problems.","Histopathology","The interpretation of colorectal biopsies taken for the initial diagnosis of chronic idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is challenging. Subclassification of IBD as ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease, which may be particularly difficult, is the subject of this review. Biopsies taken at first presentation are emphasised, partly because their features have not been modified by time or treatment. Aspects of longstanding disease and of resections are also mentioned. The first part of the review comprises background considerations and a summary of histological features that are discriminant, according to published evidence, between UC and Crohn's disease in initial biopsies. Pitfalls and problems associated with making the distinction between UC and Crohn's disease are then discussed. These include: mimics of IBD; inadequate clinical details; unreliable microscopic features; absence of histological changes in early IBD; discontinuity in UC; cryptolytic granulomas; differences between paediatric and adult UC; reliance on ileal and oesophagogastroduodenal histology; and atypical features in IBD resections. Avoidance by pathologists of known pitfalls should increase the likelihood of accurate and confident subclassification of IBD, which is important for optimum medical and surgical management.","24266813","2014","2"
"1689","Whole-Genome Analyses of Lung Function, Height and Smoking.","Annals of human genetics","A joint analysis of FEV1 (forced expiratory volume after one second) and height is reported using novel methodology, as well as a single-trait analysis of smoking status. A first goal of the study was to incorporate dense genetic marker information in a random regression (Bayesian) model to quantify the relative contributions of genomic and environmental factors to the relationship between FEV1 and height. Smoking status was analysed using a probit random regression model and a second goal of the study was to estimate the genomic heritability of smoking status. Estimates of genomic heritabilities for height and FEV1 are equal to 0.47 and to 0.30, respectively. The estimates of the genomic and environmental correlations between height and FEV1 are 0.78 and 0.34, respectively. The posterior mean of the genomic heritability of smoking status is equal to 0.14 and provides evidence for the presence of genetic factors associated with the trait. Under the data augmentation strategy introduced, the joint posterior distribution of FEV1 and height factorises into two independent posterior distributions. This simplifies programming and results in excellent numerical behaviour. The approach can be readily extended for the joint analysis of an arbitrary number of traits. Details are shown in an Appendix.","25081033","2014","8"

We conducted a series of ordinary least-squares regressions in which children's scores on direct child assessments of vocabulary, mathematical knowledge, and motor skills, as well as kindergarten teacher reports of socioemotional functioning, were linearly regressed on early televiewing.<br />RESULTS: Every SD increase (1.2â€‰h) in daily televiewing at 29 mo predicted decreases in receptive vocabulary, number knowledge scores, classroom engagement, and gross motor locomotion scores, as well as increases in the frequency of victimization by classmates.<br />CONCLUSION: Increases in total time watching television at 29 mo were associated with subsequent decreases in vocabulary and math skills, classroom engagement (which is largely determined by attention skills), victimization by classmates, and physical prowess at kindergarten. These prospective associations, independent of key potential confounders, suggest the need for better parental awareness and compliance with existing viewing recommendations put forth by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).","23788060","2013","9"
"1691","Studies of the symptom abdominal pain--a systematic review and meta-analysis.","Family practice","BACKGROUND: Diagnostic reasoning in primary care patients with abdominal pain is a complex challenge for GPs. To ensure evidence-based decision making for this symptom, GPs need setting-specific knowledge about the prevalence, potential risks for diseases and chance of recovery or risk of undesirable courses of disease.<br />AIM: We conducted a systematic review of symptom-evaluating studies on prevalence, aetiology or prognosis of abdominal pain.<br />METHODS: We included all studies evaluating the symptom 'abdominal pain' as a reason for consultation in primary care. We included all types of study designs except for qualitative studies. Studies focussed solely on children or settings other than primary care were also excluded.<br />RESULTS: We identified 14 studies. Mean consultation prevalence is 2.8% for abdominal pain. In about one-third of patients the underlying cause of abdominal pain cannot be specified. The most common aetiologies are gastroenteritis (7.2-18.7%), irritable bowel disease (2.6-13.2%), urological cause (5.3%) and gastritis (5.2%). About 1 in 10 abdominal pain patients suffers from an acute disease like appendicitis (1.9%), diverticulitis (3.0%), biliary/pancreatic (4.0%) or neoplastic (1.0%) diseases needing immediate therapy.<br />CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of patients consulting GPs for abdominal pain. The review identified a comparably high rate of acute underlying diseases in need of further investigation or therapy. At the same time, the underlying cause of the complaints often remains unexplained. Further symptom-evaluating studies are necessary, ideally using standardized methodology in order to gain sufficient evidence for developing much-needed guidelines and decision support tools.","24987023","2014","10"
"1692","Cytomegalovirus immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome manifesting as acute appendicitis in an HIV-infected patient.","BMC infectious diseases","BACKGROUND: Appendicitis occurs with increased frequency in HIV infected compared to HIV uninfected persons. CMV-related appendicitis specifically presents with typical appendicitis symptoms including surgical abdomen, fever and leukocytosis and may have a more severe course with higher mortality than other types of infective appendicitis. We report the first case of CMV appendicitis as a manifestation of Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS).<br />CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 38Â year old woman with a recent diagnosis of HIV infection who complained of right lower quadrant pain, anorexia, nausea and fevers two weeks after initiating antiretroviral therapy. Acute appendicitis was suspected and the patient underwent an appendectomy. Pathologic examination of the resected appendiceal tissue demonstrated inflammation with perforation and cytopathic changes typical of CMV that were positive for CMV by immunostain. This presentation of CMV abruptly after antiretroviral therapy initiation with a pronounced cellular infiltration of the tissue, is consistent with CMV-IRIS presenting as appendicitis.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Appendicitis can be a rare manifestation of CMV-IRIS in HIV-infected patients who start antiretroviral therapy. Evaluation of appendiceal tissue for cytopathic changes and CMV should be considered in acute appendicitis in HIV infected persons.","24910267","2014",\N
"1693","Fractured metallic biliary stent causing obstruction and jejunal perforation.","Asian journal of endoscopic surgery","Interventional internal drainage of the biliary tract has become an established procedure for both the temporary and definitive treatment of biliary obstruction due to malignant or benign disease. Biliary stent migration and stent fracture are known but rare complications. A 50-year-old man presented with acute onset pain in the abdomen and vomiting. He had undergone hepaticojejunostomy following a bile duct injury during open cholecystectomy 13 years before he presented at our institution. Subsequently, he developed a benign biliary stricture at the anastomotic site, which was stented transhepatically by a metallic stent. CT of his abdomen showed a fractured stent segment obstructing the jejunum with a localized perforation. Herein, we discuss his presentation and course of management, and review the factors influencing stent migration and fracture and the potential options for stent retrieval. The patient needed surgical intervention to retrieve the migrated fragment of metal stent and to resect the perforated jejunal segment. The role of endoscopic self-expanding metal stents for benign biliary disease remains controversial. A migrated stent that has become symptomatic should be removed endoscopically in early and accessible cases and surgically when endoscopic measures fail or when complicated by obstruction or perforation.","23879419","2013","8"
"1694","Feasibility of a nonoperative management strategy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis in children.","Journal of the American College of Surgeons","BACKGROUND: For decades, urgent operation has been considered the only appropriate management of acute appendicitis in children. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of nonoperative management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in children.<br />STUDY DESIGN: A prospective nonrandomized clinical trial of children with uncomplicated acute appendicitis comparing nonoperative management with urgent appendectomy was performed. The primary result was 30-day success rate of nonoperative management. Secondary outcomes included comparisons of disability days, missed school days, hospital length of stay, and measures of quality of life and health care satisfaction.<br />RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were enrolled during October 2012 to October 2013; 30 chose nonoperative management and 47 chose surgery. There were no significant differences in demographic or clinical characteristics. The immediate and 30-day success rates of nonoperative management were 93% (28 of 30) and 90% (27 of 30). There was no evidence of progression of appendicitis to rupture at the time of surgery in the 3 patients for whom nonoperative management failed. Compared with the surgery group, the nonoperative group had fewer disability days (3 vs 17 days; p < 0.0001), returned to school more quickly (3 vs 5 days; p = 0.008), and exhibited higher quality of life scores in both the child (93 vs 88; p = 0.01) and the parent (96 vs 90; p = 0.03), but incurred a longer length of stay (38 vs 20 hours; p < 0.0001).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Nonoperative management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in children is feasible, with a high 30-day success rate and short-term benefits that include quicker recovery and improved quality of life scores. Additional follow-up will allow for determination of longer-term success rate, safety, and cost effectiveness.","24951281","2014","8"
"1695","Predictive parameters of accelerated muscle loss in men-MINOS study.","The American journal of medicine","BACKGROUND: Aging-related muscle loss is a public health problem. We investigated the association of lifestyle and hormonal factors with a prospectively assessed muscle loss in older men.<br />METHODS: Among 608 home-dwelling men, aged 60-85 (mean 68) years, lifestyle and health status were evaluated through a questionnaire. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass was estimated using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and calculated as the sum of lean mass of the 4 limbs. Free testosterone concentration was calculated using concentrations of total testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin. Longitudinal data were analyzed by hierarchical models.<br />RESULTS: Average muscle loss was 0.63 Â± 0.05%/year. The results of our multivariable adjusted analyses showed that muscle loss was higher in men whose leisure physical activity was <15 hours/week versus â‰¥15 hours/week (-0.76 vs -0.57%/year). Age-related acceleration of muscle loss was greater in men with lower total testosterone levels (<10 vs â‰¥10 nmol/L: -0.10 vs -0.07%/year/year of age at baseline [age]). Men with lower free testosterone (<75 vs â‰¥75 pmol/L) had greater age-related acceleration of muscle loss (-0.12 vs -0.08%/year/age). Higher parathyroid hormone concentrations were associated with greater age-related acceleration of muscle loss (â‰¥45 vs <45 pg/mL -0.14 vs -0.12%/year/age). Men with type 2 diabetes had higher age-related acceleration of muscle loss versus men without diabetes (-0.08 vs -0.03%/year/age) (All P values are <.05).<br />CONCLUSION: In elderly men, low leisure physical activity, type 2 diabetes, low total and free testosterone, and elevated parathyroid hormone concentrations are associated with greater age-related acceleration of muscle loss. These factors are likely to represent real determinants of aging-related muscle loss in men.","24524994","2014","6"

Part B","Acute leukemia (AL) in children can mimic several orthopedic pathologies at presentation, with a variable delay in the correct diagnosis. This is a major problem, which may result in fractures, loss of mobility, and deformity, with resultant adverse effects on quality of life. Here, we studied the clinical and radiological musculoskeletal manifestations in children with AL. We reviewed 328 children [208 boys (62%), median age 7.2 years] with acute lymphoblastic (279, 85%) or myeloid (49, 15%) leukemia, treated between January 1982 and December 2003 by the Paediatric Oncology Service, Second University of Naples. The group was further divided into two groups: group 1 included 255 patients (78%, 163 boys) without skeletal morbidity at diagnosis, and group 2 included 73 patients (22%, 41 boys) with musculoskeletal symptoms. This group was further subdivided into group 2A (56 patients), which included children with symptoms related to the appendicular skeleton, and group 2B (17 patients), which included children with symptoms related to the axial skeleton. Moreover, we also reported the long-term complications of therapy, such as osteonecrosis of the weight-bearing joints. In group 2A, 44 children presented only pain, seven septic arthritis-type symptoms, and five osteomyelitis-type symptoms. Joint compression was in the tibia-tarsus (21 patients), knee (16), coxofemoral (12), and elbow (seven). In group 2B, 11 patients presented with vertebral collapses. The remaining six patients complained of localized pain in the lumbar-sacral area, with limited flexor and extensor muscle capacity. Fifty-five (75.3%) patients showed radiographic abnormalities: osteoporosis in 22 patients (40%), pathological fractures in 11 (20%), osteolysis in 10 (18.1%), osteosclerosis in five (9%), periosteal reactions in four (7.2%), and metaphyseal bands in three (5.4%). Four (1.2%) patients in total showed avascular necrosis (4.3% when only high-risk patients were considered). At presentation, 22% of our children had at least one musculoskeletal manifestation and 75.3% showed one radiographic change. Our study highlights the importance of including AL in the differential diagnosis of musculoskeletal manifestations. Four cases of avascular necrosis confirm the need for regular check-ups, both orthopedic and nonorthopedic, particularly in adolescent girls, to prevent permanent disability.","23407432","2013","5"

Bioelectrical impedance measurements of lean body mass were taken annually. A sarcopenia threshold was defined arbitrarily as an appendicular lean mass/height(2) of more than 1 standard deviation below the mean for healthy young Japanese.<br />RESULTS: Subjects with greater habitual physical activity retained a greater lean mass over the 5 years of observation. Controlling for baseline lean mass and age, final lean mass was greater for the third activity quartile (men and women with respective mean counts of 7,800 and 7,700 steps per day or mean duration of exercise at >3 metabolic equivalents (METs) of 20 and 17 minutes per day) than for the first and second quartiles. A multivariate-adjusted proportional hazards model predicted that, over the 5 years, men and women in the two lowest activity quartiles (<6,700 and <6,800 steps per day) were 2.3 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.4-4.5) and 3.0 (95% CI = 1.9-3.4) times as likely, respectively, to be sarcopenic as those in the highest activity quartile (>9,000 and >8,400 steps per day). Likewise, men and women with less than 16 and less than 14 minutes per day, respectively, of activity of more than 3 METs were 3.0 (95% CI = 2.0-6.0) and 3.5 (95% CI = 2.1-6.3) times as likely to develop sarcopenia as those with more than 28 and more than 22 minutes per day.<br />CONCLUSION: After adjustment for potential confounders, the risk of developing sarcopenia was substantially lower in elderly people taking at least 7,000 to 8,000 steps per day or exercising for at least 15 to 20 minutes per day at an intensity greater than 3 METs.

"1698","Abdominal attacks and treatment in hereditary angioedema with C1-inhibitor deficiency.","BMC gastroenterology","BACKGROUND: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is characterized by unpredictable attacks of debilitating subcutaneous and mucosal edema. Gastrointestinal attacks are painful, of sudden onset and often mistaken for acute abdomen leading to unnecessary surgery. The purpose of this study was to analyze symptom presentation of gastrointestinal angioedema in pediatric and adult HAE patients.<br />METHODS: Information collected during the clinical development of ecallantide for treatment of acute HAE attacks included affected anatomic location, accompanying symptoms, medical history, and pain assessments. Efficacy endpoints included Treatment Outcome Score (TOS, maximum score = 100; minimally important difference = 30), a point-in-time measure of treatment response, and time to treatment response.<br />RESULTS: Forty-nine percent of 521 HAE attacks only involved abdominal symptoms. The most commonly reported abdominal symptoms were distension (77%), cramping (73%) and nausea (67%). The most common pain descriptors were tender, tiring-exhausting, aching, cramping and sickening. White blood cell counts were elevated (>10 Ã— 10(9)/L) in 23% of attacks (mean Â± SD: 15.1 Â± 11.27 Ã— 10(9)/L). A high proportion of patients reported a history of abdominal surgery, including appendectomy (23%), cholecystectomy (16.4%), and hysterectomy (8.2%). Mean TOS at 4 hours post ecallantide was 77 Â± 33 versus 29 Â± 65 for placebo. Median time to significant symptom resolution was 165 minutes (95% CI 136, 167) for ecallantide versus >4 hours (95% CI 161, >4 hours) for placebo. Anaphylactic reactions occurred in 6 of the 149 treated patients.<br />CONCLUSIONS: HAE should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with recurrent discrete episodes of severe, unexplained crampy abdominal pain associated with nausea.<br />TRIALS REGISTRATION: The data used in the analysis were gathered across multiple clinical trials conducted during the clinical development program for ecallantide. All of the studies were conducted using Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origins in the Declaration of Helsinki.

When to perform surgery remains controversial. To find out whether laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed for acute cholecystitis irrespective of the time since onset of acute symptoms. A total of 200 laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed for acute cholecystitis were evaluated for duration of surgery, conversion rates, biliary and other organ injury, and postoperative stay. Kruskal-Wallis tests, Mann-Whitney tests, and paired t-tests using SPSS software. Thirty patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy within 48Â h of onset of symptoms (group 1), 60 patients underwent surgery between 48Â h and 6Â weeks of onset of symptoms (group 2), and 110 patients underwent surgery after 6Â weeks of onset of symptoms (group 3). While the duration of surgery was significantly shorter in group 3 compared to groups 1 and 2 (57.5Â min vs. 53.5Â min vs. 34.2Â min), there were no conversions or major biliary or other organ injury in any of the three groups. Postoperative stay was also comparable between the three groups (3Â days vs. 3.1Â days vs. 3.08Â days).

"1702","A new technique for liver retraction during single-port laparoscopic surgery.","Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques. Part A","Establishing a clear operative viewing field and adequate working space are essential steps for safe laparoscopic surgery. This aim of this article is to report a new technique of liver retraction during upper gastrointestinal laparoscopic surgery. This technique is fast and simple and precludes the use of special devices. It avoids the use of a subxiphoid trocar exclusive for liver retraction. This technique was designed to be used in single-port laparoscopic surgery but can be used in standard laparoscopic surgery to reduce the number of trocars. The first step is to perform division of the left triangular ligament. The fibrous appendix is identified. A window in the falciform ligament is created. The fibrous appendix is sutured to the peritoneum in the right subcostal area. The left lobe of the liver passes through the window in the falciform ligament, avoiding liver congestion. Optimum exposure of the upper gastrointestinal area is achieved. This new technique is easy and can be performed in various types of laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgeries without the need for specific skills or devices. We believe that our liver retraction technique is useful in single-port laparoscopic surgery and allows an excellent exposure of the upper gastrointestinal tract.","24206121","2014","1"

In practice","With the rising prevalence of atopic disease, primary prevention may play a role in reducing its burden, especially in high-risk infants. With this in mind, the Adverse Reactions to Foods Committee of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology was charged with the task of developing recommendations for primary care physicians and specialists about the primary prevention of allergic disease through nutritional interventions according to current available literature and expert opinion. Recommendations that are supported by data are as follows. Avoidance diets during pregnancy and lactation are not recommended at this time, but more research is necessary for peanut. Exclusive breast-feeding for at least 4 and up to 6 months is endorsed. For high-risk infants who cannot be exclusively breast-fed, hydrolyzed formula appears to offer advantages to prevent allergic disease and cow's milk allergy. Complementary foods can be introduced between 4 and 6 months of age. Because no formal recommendations have been previously provided about how and when to introduce the main allergenic foods (cow's milk, egg, soy, wheat, peanut, tree nuts, fish, shellfish), these are now provided, and reasons to consider allergy consultation for development of a personalized plan for food introduction are also presented.","24229819","2013","1"
"1704","Nuclear transcription factor Îº B activation and protein turnover adaptations in skeletal muscle of patients with progressive stages of lung cancer cachexia.","The American journal of clinical nutrition","BACKGROUND: Experimental models of cancer cachexia have indicated that systemic inflammation induces muscle-protein breakdown and wasting via muscular nuclear transcription factor ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) activation. This process may limit the efficacy of nutritional intervention.<br />OBJECTIVES: We assessed muscle NF-ÎºB activity and protein turnover signaling in progressive stages of clinical lung cancer cachexia and assessed whether circulating factors can induce muscular NF-ÎºB activity.<br />DESIGN: Patients with lung cancer precachexia (n = 10) and cachexia (n = 16) were cross-sectionally compared with 22 healthy control subjects. mRNA transcripts of muscle proteolytic (ubiquitin proteasome system and autophagy lysosomal pathway) and myogenic markers and protein expression of PI3K/Akt, myostatin, and autophagy signaling were measured. A multiplex analysis showed the systemic inflammatory status, whereas plasma exposure to stable NF-ÎºB-luciferase-reporter muscle cells revealed NF-ÎºB inducibility.<br />RESULTS: Compared with healthy control subjects, cachectic patients had reduced (appendicular) muscle mass (-10%), muscle fiber atrophy (-27%), and decreased quadriceps strength (-31%). Subtle alterations in the muscle morphology were also detectable in precachectic patients, without changes in body composition. Despite increased Akt phosphorylation, downstream phosphosubstrates glycogen synthase kinase 3Î², mammalian target of rapamycin, and Forkhead box protein were unaltered. The expression of autophagy effectors B cell lymphoma 2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa protein-interacting protein 3 and microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B gradually increased from precachectic to cachectic patients, without differences in E3 ubiquitin ligases. Systemic and local inflammation was evident in cachexia and intermediate in precachexia, but the plasma of both patients groups caused ex vivo muscle NF-ÎºB activation.<br />CONCLUSIONS: In lung cancer, muscular NF-ÎºB activity is induced by factors contained within the circulation. Autophagy may contribute to increased muscle proteolysis in lung cancer cachexia, whereas the absence of downstream changes in phosphosubstrates despite increased Akt phosphorylation suggests impaired anabolic signaling that may require targeted nutritional intervention.","23902785","2013","9"
"1705","Comparison of Urinary Tract Infection Rates Among 2- to 12-Month-Old Febrile Infants With RSV Infections Using 1999 and 2011 AAP Diagnostic Criteria.","Clinical pediatrics","Background. Infants with RSV infections have been found to have a clinically significant rate of urinary tract infections (UTIs). The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) published a revised Clinical Practice Guideline on UTIs in 2011, which includes major changes in diagnostic criteria for UTIs. Past research has been done using previous diagnostic criteria. The objective of the study is to assess the rate of UTIs in febrile infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections according to the 2011 revised AAP Diagnostic Criteria and compare the rate of UTIs against the 1999 AAP Diagnostic Criteria. Methods. A retrospective comparative study of febrile infants (2-12 months) with RSV infections admitted to the Inpatient Pediatric unit of Lincoln Medical and Mental Center, Bronx, NY, from September through April 2006 to 2012. We applied the AAP's 1999 and 2011 diagnostic criteria for UTIs separately to assess the rates of UTIs. Results. A total of 359 RSV-positive febrile patients who were investigated for UTIs were enrolled. Pyuria was found in 11.1% (40/359), positive urine culture 10 000 to 50 000 was found in 1.4% (5/359) and â‰¥50 000 in 4.7% (17/359). The rate of UTIs using AAP's 1999 criteria was 6.1% (22/359), and using the 2011 criteria the rate was 1.1% (4/359). The rate of UTIs was significantly different between the 2 groups (odds ratio [confidence interval] = 0.17 [0.05, 0.5], P = .001). Conclusions. The rate of UTIs in RSV-positive febrile infants is very low (1.1%) with the 2011 AAP diagnostic criteria. Previously described increased risk of UTIs may represent asymptomatic bacteriuria or contaminated specimens.","24681546","2014","3"

The incidence is estimated at about 1-2/100,000,000 per year. The primary tumor site is usually discovered in the appendix or- in case of women--in ovaries, appearing as tumors of low malignancy. Making an accurate diagnosis causes difficulties--symptoms tend to be misleading, suggesting more frequent pathologies of the abdominal cavity. It is also not rare that the patient is for a long time asymptomatic. We present a case of a 68-year-old patient of the Surgical Oncology Department treated for pseudomyxoma peritonei, diagnosed incidentally at the time of clinical examination for the reasons of chronic hypertension. The symptoms reported by the patient did not suggest any neoplastic process of the peritoneal cavity. Systemic chemotherapy of two paths (a total number of 10 cycles) did not result and at the time of post-treatment control, due to no response to standard chemotherapy, it was decided to administer chemotherapy intraperitoneally in hyperthermia (HIPEC). During the operation, peritoneal cytoreduction prior to the scheduled HIPEC was performed; the right-sided inguinal hernia was repaired. Within the hernia sac the implanted myxoid cells were found, their presence inside was probably the main reason of clinical manifestation of the disease.","24340893","2013","10"
"1707","Significance of Proximal Margin Involvement in Low-Grade Appendiceal Mucinous Neoplasms.","Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine","Context .- Appendiceal adenomas and low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms (LAMNs) confined to the appendix are cured by appendectomy. However, involvement of the proximal margin raises concern for residual disease. Some patients with a positive margin at appendectomy undergo cecal resection to eliminate a perceived risk for tumor recurrence or dissemination, although that likelihood is assumed rather than demonstrated. Objective .- To determine whether involvement of the proximal appendiceal resection margin by adenoma or LAMN is a risk factor for local development of recurrence or pseudomyxoma peritonei. Design .- Appendiceal adenomas and LAMNs confined to the appendix were considered for the study if they showed neoplasia or dissecting mucin at the proximal margin. The presence or absence of residual tumor in cecal resections was determined. Follow-up data were obtained from clinical records. Results .- 16 patients (14 female, 2 male) with LAMN (n = 15) or adenoma (n = 1) and an involved proximal resection margin were identified, including 9 with neoplastic epithelium within the lumen and 7 with acellular mucin in the appendiceal wall at the margin. Six patients underwent cecal resection and the others were nonsurgically followed. No cecal resection had residual neoplasia. No patient developed recurrence or pseudomyxoma peritonei (mean follow-up, 4.7 years). Conclusions .- In patients with LAMNs confined to the appendix, involvement of the appendectomy margin by neoplastic epithelium or acellular mucin does not predict recurrence of disease, even without further surgery. A conservative approach to managing these patients can be justified.","24971927","2014","6"

With the clinical suspicion of appendicitis, an abdominal CT scan was performed, which revealed mesenteric lymphadenitis. The patient was hospitalised and treated with antibiotics, but was ultimately found to have Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD). This diagnosis was facilitated by the use of positron emission tomography scan that identified an accessible inguinal lymph node for biopsy and histopathological evaluation. Invasive abdominal surgery was thereby averted and the patient made a complete recovery on subsequent follow-up. Review of the published literature reveals that pseudoappendicitis due to KFD is a rare occurrence that has generally required abdominal surgery to establish the diagnosis, thus supporting the potential value of the approach taken here.","24899010","2014",\N

"1710","Focus on the intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas.","Gastroenterology and hepatology from bed to bench","Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are rare pancreatic tumours, accounting for less of 1-2% of all neoplasms of the gland. Main characteristics of IPMNs are their favourable prognosis as these pre-malignant or frankly malignant lesions are usually slow-growing tumours and radical surgery is frequently possible. According with the localization of the lesions, three different entities are identified: the main-duct IPMN (type I), the branch-duct IPMN (type II) and the mixed type (type III, involving both the main pancreatic duct and side branches). IMPNs do not present pathognomonic signs or symptoms. Obstruction of the main pancreatic duct system may cause abdominal pain and acute pancreatitis (single or recurrent episodes). The tumour may be incidentally discovered in asymptomatic patients, particularly in those with branch-duct IPMNs. In clinical practice, any non-inflammatory cystic lesion of the pancreas should be considered as possible IPMN. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging with cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic ultrasonography can localize IPMN and assess its morphology and size. The choice between non-operative and surgical management strictly depends from the risk of malignancy and of the definitively distinction between benign and malignant IPMNs. Main-duct IPMNs are at higher risk of malignant degeneration, especially in older patients; as a consequence no doubt does not exist as concerns the need of surgery for IPMN type I and III. A less aggressive surgical approach as well as the possibility of conservative management have been suggested for asymptomatic, small size (< 3-3.5 cm), branch-duct IPMN.","24834213","2012",\N

Significant associations between grip strength and all the outcome measures persisted after adjustment for 8 potential confounders, including Barthel Index scores before rehabilitation, age, number of medications, number of comorbidities, pressure ulcers, concomitant infections, time between fracture occurrence and assessment, and aLM/height(2).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Grip strength, but not DXA-assessed aLM, significantly predicted short-term functional outcome in women after a hip fracture.","24769122","2014","9"
"1713","Acute abdominal and pelvic pain in pregnancy: ESUR recommendations.","European radiology","Acute abdominal pain in pregnancy presents diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Standard imaging techniques need to be adapted to reduce harm to the fetus from X-rays due to their teratogenic and carcinogenic potential. Ultrasound remains the primary imaging investigation of the pregnant abdomen. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to be useful in the diagnosis of gynaecological and obstetric problems during pregnancy and in the setting of acute abdomen during pregnancy. MRI overcomes some of the limitations of ultrasound, mainly the size of the gravid uterus. MRI poses theoretical risks to the fetus and care must be taken to minimise these with the avoidance of contrast agents. This article reviews the evolving imaging and clinical literature on appropriate investigation of acute abdominal and pelvic pain during established intrauterine pregnancy, addressing its common causes. Guidelines based on the current literature and on the accumulated clinico-radiological experience of the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) working group are proposed for imaging these suspected conditions.","23990045","2013","12"
"1714","Estimating the burden of acute gastrointestinal illness in Grenada.","Journal of health, population, and nutrition","This is the first study conducted in Grenada, with a population of approximately 108,000, to quantify the magnitude, distribution, and burden of self-reported acute gastroenteritis (AGE). A retrospective population survey was conducted in October 2008 and April 2009 and a laboratory survey from October 2008 to September 2009. The estimated monthly prevalence of AGE was 10.7% (95% CI 9.0-12.6; 1.4 episodes/ person-year), with a median of 3 days of illness. Of those who reported AGE, 31% sought medical care (stool samples were requested from 12.5%); 10% took antibiotics; 45% took non-prescribed medication; and 81% reported restricted activity. Prevalence of AGE was significantly higher among children aged <5 years (23.5%, p < 0.001). Of the AGE stool samples submitted to the laboratory for analysis, 12.1% were positive for a foodborne pathogen. Salmonella enteritidis was the most common foodborne pathogen associated with AGE-related illness. The estimated percentage of underreporting of syndromic AGE to the Ministry of Health was 69%. In addition, for every laboratory-confirmed foodborne/AGE pathogen, it was estimated that there were 316 additional cases occurring in the population. The minimum estimated cost associated with treatment for AGE was US$ 703,950 each year, showing that AGE has a potentially significant economic impact in Grenada.","24992809","2013","12"

This work analyzes the interaction of the pump unit of an electrically driven pulsatile Total Artificial Heart (TAH) and the mediastinum. For an adequate compliance, both overall dimensions and alignment of inlets and outlets must be matched.<br />METHODS: Cross-sectional medical image data of 27 individuals, including male and female patients suffering from end stage heart failure, was segmented and reconstructed to three dimensional (3D) surface models. Dimensions and orientations of relevant structures were identified and analyzed. The TAH surface model was virtually placed in orthotopic position and aligned with atrioventricular valves and big vessels. Additionally seven conventional cadaver studies were performed to validate different pump chamber designs based on virtual findings. Thereby 3D-coordinates were captured and introduced to the virtual environment to allow quantitative comparison between different individuals.<br />RESULTS: Spatial parameters varied more in male patients with higher values if heart failure persists. Good correlation of the virtual analysis both to literature data and conventional cadaver studies could be shown. The full data of the 27 individuals as well as the summarized values found in literature are enclosed in the appendix. By superimposing the TAH-volume model to the anatomy, various misalignments were found and the TAH-design was adjusted.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Virtual fitting allows implant design adjustments in realistic anatomy which has not been influenced by thoracotomy. Higher numbers of relevant individuals can be reasonably investigated in the virtual environment and quantitatively correlated. Using this approach, conventional cadaver studies can be significantly reduced but not obviated, due to the unavailable haptic feedback and immobility of potentially compressed structures.","23941400","2013",\N

Vasculitis of the gallbladder causing acute cholecystitis is an extremely rare manifestation of rheumatoid vasculitis. To our knowledge, this is the first case in which vasculitis occurred early in the course of disease. We report the case of a localised gallbladder vasculitis in a 74-year-old, newly diagnosed male patient with RA. He presented with acute abdominal pain, a history of constitutional symptoms and a 1-week history of polyarthritis of his wrist and hands. Cholecystitis was diagnosed clinically and radiologically and he underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Histopathology of the gallbladder confirmed cholecystitis and gallstones but in addition found small vessel vasculitis and rheumatoid nodules. This case illustrates that rheumatoid vasculitis can occur early in the onset of RA. Additionally, although rare, the gallbladder can be a site of localised rheumatoid vasculitis.","23975907","2013",\N

Approximately 15 million hospital stays each year in the United States involve OR procedures. On average, hospital stays that involve an OR procedure have been reported to be 2.5 times more costly than stays that do not involve an OR procedure. Identifying the volume, characteristics, and costs of OR procedures can help policymakers and researchers better understand population health and facilitate health care improvement efforts. Changes in health care provider payment arrangements and advances in medical practice and technology can impact the nature of the procedures that are performed in hospital operating rooms. For example, some less complex surgical procedures, such as cataract surgery, that were once routinely performed in inpatient hospital operating rooms are now primarily performed in the ambulatory surgery setting. This Statistical Brief presents data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) on characteristics of OR procedures in 2011. For this Statistical Brief, OR procedures are defined using the HCUP procedure classes tool. In this tool, OR procedures are identified based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) that use physician panels to determine whether the procedure would be performed in a hospital OR in most hospitals. The findings in this Statistical Brief represent an update to 2007 statistics reported by Elixhauser and Andrews. Patient characteristics, resource use, and outcomes are provided for stays with and without OR procedures. The most frequent and most costly OR procedures also are presented.

"1720","Short bowel syndrome after laparoscopic procedures.","The American surgeon","Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a potential postoperative complication after intra-abdominal procedures. Whether the laparoscopic approach is as likely to result in SBS or the causative mechanisms are similar to open procedures is unknown. Our aim was to evaluate potential mechanisms of SBS after laparoscopic procedures. The records of 175 adult patients developing SBS as a postoperative complication were reviewed. One hundred forty-seven patients had open procedures and 28 laparoscopic. Colectomy (39%), hysterectomy (11%), and appendectomy (11%) were the most common open procedures. SBS followed laparoscopic gastric bypass (46%) and cholecystectomy (32%) most frequently. The mechanisms of SBS were different: adhesive obstruction (57 vs 22%, P < 0.05) was more common in the open group, whereas volvulus (18 vs 46%, P < 0.05) was more common after laparoscopy. Overall, ischemia (25 vs 32%) was similar but significantly more laparoscopic patients had postoperative hypoperfusion (32 vs 67%, P < 0.05). Eleven of the 13 laparoscopic bariatric procedures had internal hernias and volvulus. Of the nine patients undergoing cholecystectomy, four developed ischemia early postoperatively presumably secondary to pneumoperitoneum. SBS is an increasingly recognized complication of laparoscopic procedures. The mechanisms of intestinal injury differ from open procedures with a higher incidence of volvulus and more frequent ischemia from hypoperfusion.","24887670","2014","4"

This study examines patient outcomes and critically evaluates its patterns of recurrences relative to the site of metastatic origin.<br />METHODS: Patients treated with CS/IPC from 2000 to 2012 where PM arose from a primary tumour of the appendix, colon and rectum were identified from a prospective database for retrospective evaluation. The primary end points were survival (overall and disease-free), and secondary end points include patterns of recurrence and prognostic factors associated with overall outcomes.<br />RESULTS: Two hundred and eleven patients were followed up for a median of 23.3Â months (range 1-156). Overall median survival was 46.8Â months, and the 1-, 3-, 5-year survival rates were 87, 56 and 42Â %, respectively. The 5-year survival of patients with appendiceal, colonic and rectal PM was 55, 33 and 20Â %, respectively. Tumour origin was the only independent prognostic factor associated with overall survival (pÂ =Â 0.03). Recurrences were more common in patients of colorectal origin over appendiceal origin (pÂ <Â 0.001) and were more likely to be of a systemic nature (pÂ =Â 0.05).<br />CONCLUSION: CS/IPC provides an option for improved survival in patients with PM of lower gastrointestinal origin and appears to be most promising in patients with disease of appendiceal origin.","24022087","2013","9"

We assessed their response to lithium treatment using the Alda scale and performed a genomewide association study on samples from one subgroup of 294 patients with bipolar I disorder who were receiving lithium treatment. We then tested the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that showed the strongest association with a response to lithium for association in a replication sample of 100 patients and tested them further in a follow-up sample of 24 patients. We sequenced the exons, exon-intron boundaries, and part of the promoter of the gene encoding glutamate decarboxylase-like protein 1 (GADL1) in 94 patients who had a response to lithium and in 94 patients who did not have a response in the genomewide association sample.<br />RESULTS: Two SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium, rs17026688 and rs17026651, that are located in the introns of GADL1 showed the strongest associations in the genomewide association study (P=5.50Ã—10(-37) and P=2.52Ã—10(-37), respectively) and in the replication sample of 100 patients (P=9.19Ã—10(-15) for each SNP). These two SNPs had a sensitivity of 93% for predicting a response to lithium and differentiated between patients with a good response and those with a poor response in the follow-up cohort.

Most of the time it involves the pelvis; however, sites of endometriosis have been reported almost anywhere in the body. Appendiceal and primary umbilical endometriosis are considered rare loci, making accurate diagnosis elusive. Here we present the case of a 46-year-old woman with concurrent appendiceal and umbilical endometriosis.<br />CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old Greek woman presented with a large mass in the lower abdomen adhering to the surrounding organs. She reported recurrent lower abdominal and pelvic pain and the presence of a dark-blue hard nodule at the umbilicus. She had no previous medical, surgical or gynecological history. Her physical examination and laboratory test results were without any significant findings. The laparotomy revealed a fibromatose uterus adhering to the rectum and a urinary cyst and a palpable mass in the vermiform appendix. A hysterectomy and an appendectomy were performed. The umbilical mass was also excised. Pathology revealed endometriosis of the umbilicus and the appendix. The postoperative period was uneventful and she was discharged.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Endometriosis, although rare, should always be considered in women of reproductive age, presenting with cyclic pain. The diagnosis is, most of the time, difficult and requires a high degree of clinical suspicion. The clinical doctor should be aware that endometriosis can sometimes be multifocal, thus a thorough investigation is required in all cases.","25052818","2014",\N

A retrospective study was carried out between May 2010 and June 2013 in a single unit of the department of Surgery, Lok Nayak Hospital, Delhi. It included 400 patients of perforation peritonitis (diffuse or localized) who were studied retrospectively in terms of cause, site of perforation, surgical treatment, complications, and mortality. Only those patients who underwent exploratory laparotomy for management of perforation peritonitis were included. Results. The commonest cause of perforation peritonitis included 179 cases of peptic ulcer disease (150 duodenal ulcers and 29 gastric ulcers) followed by appendicitis (74 cases), typhoid fever (48 cases), tuberculosis (40 cases), and trauma (31). The overall mortality was 7%. Conclusions. Perforation peritonitis in India has a different spectrum as compared to the western countries. Peptic ulcer perforation, perforating appendicitis, typhoid, and tubercular perforations are the major causes of gastrointestinal perforations. Early surgical intervention under the cover of broad spectrum antibiotics preceded by adequate aggressive resuscitation and correction of electrolyte imbalances is imperative for good outcomes minimizing morbidity and mortality.","25006512","2014",\N

Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is easy to perform, non-invasive, relatively inexpensive, and portable. However, the accuracy of measurement by BIA is questionable. To develop and cross-validate the predictive equation for estimated appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) using BIA in older community-dwelling Korean adults, we include two cohorts: study participants aged 65-80 years in the Ansung cohort for the Korean Health and Genome Study (men, n=285; women, n=435) used as equation-generating group, and Korean Longitudinal Study of Health Aging (KLoSHA) as cross-validation group (men, n=202; women, n=208). Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and BIA were performed in both cohorts. Using multiple linear regression analysis, we drew a predictive equation for DXA-measured ASM by BIA resistance.

The study's four objectives were to determine the diagnostic criteria, characteristics, predictors, and 30-day outcomes of MINS.<br />METHODS: In this international, prospective cohort study of 15,065 patients aged 45 yr or older who underwent in-patient noncardiac surgery, troponin T was measured during the first 3 postoperative days. Patients with a troponin T level of 0.04 ng/ml or greater (elevated \"abnormal\" laboratory threshold) were assessed for ischemic features (i.e., ischemic symptoms and electrocardiography findings). Patients adjudicated as having a nonischemic troponin elevation (e.g., sepsis) were excluded. To establish diagnostic criteria for MINS, the authors used Cox regression analyses in which the dependent variable was 30-day mortality (260 deaths) and independent variables included preoperative variables, perioperative complications, and potential MINS diagnostic criteria.<br />RESULTS: An elevated troponin after noncardiac surgery, irrespective of the presence of an ischemic feature, independently predicted 30-day mortality. Therefore, the authors' diagnostic criterion for MINS was a peak troponin T level of 0.03 ng/ml or greater judged due to myocardial ischemia. MINS was an independent predictor of 30-day mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.87; 95% CI, 2.96-5.08) and had the highest population-attributable risk (34.0%, 95% CI, 26.6-41.5) of the perioperative complications. Twelve hundred patients (8.0%) suffered MINS, and 58.2% of these patients would not have fulfilled the universal definition of myocardial infarction.

Participants (n = 1,446, 32% female) were born near Hyderabad, India, in 29 villages from 1987 to 1990, during which time only intervention villages (n = 15) had a government program that offered balanced protein-calorie supplementation to pregnant women and children. Participants' LBM and appendicular skeletal muscle mass were measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry; grip strength and information on lifestyle indicators, including diet and physical activity level, were also obtained. Ages (mean = 20.3 years) and body mass indexes (weight (kg)/height (m)(2); mean = 19.5) of participants in 2 groups were similar. Current dietary energy intake was higher in the intervention group. Unadjusted LBM and grip strength were similar in 2 groups. After adjustment for potential confounders, the intervention group had lower LBM (Î² = -0.75; P = 0.03), appendicular skeletal muscle mass, and grip strength than did controls, but these differences were small in magnitude (<0.1 standard deviation). Multivariable regression analyses showed that current socioeconomic position, energy intake, and physical activity level had a positive association with adult LBM and muscle strength. This study could not detect a \"programming\" effect of early nutrition supplementation on adult LBM and muscle strength.","24553777","2014","3"
"1737","A new and improved confidence interval for the Mantel-Haenszel risk difference.","Statistics in medicine","Writing the variance of the Mantel-Haenszel estimator under the null of homogeneity and inverting the corresponding test, we arrive at an improved confidence interval for the common risk difference in stratified 2â€‰Ã—â€‰2 tables.

We also discuss a score-type confidence interval that allows to incorporate strata/study weights. Both of these intervals work very well under many scenarios common in stratified trials or in a meta-analysis, including situations with a mixture of both small and large strata sample sizes, unbalanced treatment allocation, or rare events. The new interval has the advantage that it is available in closed form with a simple formula. In addition, it applies to matched pairs data.

During surgery, we identified an extensive haemoperitoneum which required conversion to laparotomy without identifying focal hemorrhage. A peri-operative angiography disclosed a parietal irregularity of the upper rectal artery, without active bleeding. The patient remained stable until the 15th postoperative day, when there was clinical deterioration and hemoglobin decrease. Angio-CT revealed the presence of an upper rectal artery pseudoaneurysm with an extensive retroperitoneal and organized hematoma. The patient was proposed for surgical correction which was not carried out due to extensive inflammatory and fibrotic changes, being referred for endovascular exclusion, performed by selective catheterization and coil embolization. The procedure went without complications. Catheterization was performed upstream and downstream of the pseudoaneurysm, with microcatheter, and embolization performed with coils. Control angiography showed no filling of the aneurysm. The patient remained asymptomatic after the procedure, with clinical and analytical stability. Inferior mesenteric artery primary pseudoaneurysms are rare but potentially fatal, with formal indication for treatment, given the risks of free rupture. The use of endovascular techniques allows a minimally invasive approach, with exclusion of the PA, with high rates of primary success. Doubts remain regarding the functionality of the involved organ and long-term recurrence rates; therefore high importance is given to proper follow-up of these patients.","24490200",\N,\N
"1739","Using two different algorithms to determine the prevalence of sarcopenia.","Geriatrics & gerontology international","AIM: Several operative definitions and screening methods for sarcopenia have been proposed in previous studies; however, the opinions of researchers still differ. We compared the prevalence of sarcopenia using two different algorithms: (i) the European working group on sarcopenia in older people (EWGSOP)-suggested algorithm using gait speed as the first step; and (ii) the muscle mass and strength algorithm.<br />METHODS: A population-based, cross-sectional survey of adults aged over 65 years was carried out. Data on a total of 4811 participants were available for analysis. Gait speed, grip strength and appendicular skeletal muscle mass were assessed to determine sarcopenia. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass was estimated from bioimpedance analysis measurements and expressed as skeletal muscle mass index. Grip strength and skeletal muscle mass index were considered to be low if they fell below the threshold of the lowest 20% of values measured in a subset of healthy subjects. We compared the prevalence rates of sarcopenia determined by the two algorithms.<br />RESULTS: The prevalence rate of sarcopenia in a representative sample of older Japanese adults was 8.2% for men and 6.8% for women based on the EWGSOP algorithm. The two algorithms identified the same participants as sarcopenic, the only difference being the EWGSOP algorithm classified an additional seven participants (0.15%) into sarcopenia compared with the muscle mass and strength algorithm.<br />CONCLUSION: It is debatable whether inclusion of gait speed is necessary when screening for sarcopenia in community-dwelling older adults. Future research should examine the necessity of including gait speed in algorithms and the validity of cut-off values.","24450560","2014","2"
"1740","Microstructural parameters of bone evaluated using HR-pQCT correlate with the DXA-derived cortical index and the trabecular bone score in a cohort of randomly selected premenopausal women.","PloS one","BACKGROUND: Areal bone mineral density is predictive for fracture risk. Microstructural bone parameters evaluated at the appendicular skeleton by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) display differences between healthy patients and fracture patients. With the simple geometry of the cortex at the distal tibial diaphysis, a cortical index of the tibia combining material and mechanical properties correlated highly with bone strength ex vivo. The trabecular bone score derived from the scan of the lumbar spine by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) correlated ex vivo with the micro architectural parameters. It is unknown if these microstructural correlations could be made in healthy premenopausal women.<br />METHODS: Randomly selected women between 20-40 years of age were examined by DXA and HR-pQCT at the standard regions of interest and at customized sub regions to focus on cortical and trabecular parameters of strength separately. For cortical strength, at the distal tibia the volumetric cortical index was calculated directly from HR-pQCT and the areal cortical index was derived from the DXA scan using a Canny threshold-based tool. For trabecular strength, the trabecular bone score was calculated based on the DXA scan of the lumbar spine and was compared with the corresponding parameters derived from the HR-pQCT measurements at radius and tibia.<br />RESULTS: Seventy-two healthy women were included (average age 33.8 years, average BMI 23.2 kg/m(2)). The areal cortical index correlated highly with the volumetric cortical index at the distal tibia (R â€Š=â€Š 0.798). The trabecular bone score correlated moderately with the microstructural parameters of the trabecular bone.<br />CONCLUSION: This study in randomly selected premenopausal women demonstrated that microstructural parameters of the bone evaluated by HR-pQCT correlated with the DXA derived parameters of skeletal regions containing predominantly cortical or cancellous bone. Whether these indexes are suitable for better predictions of the fracture risk deserves further investigation.","24551194","2014",\N

"1745","Does aptitude influence the rate at which proficiency is achieved for laparoscopic appendectomy?","Journal of the American College of Surgeons","BACKGROUND: The attainment of technical competence for surgical procedures is fundamental to a proficiency-based surgical training program. We hypothesized that aptitude may directly affect one's ability to successfully complete the learning curve for minimally invasive procedures. The aim was to assess whether aptitude has an impact on ability to achieve proficiency in completing a simulated minimally invasive surgical procedure. The index procedure chosen was a laparoscopic appendectomy.<br />STUDY DESIGN: Two groups of medical students with disparate aptitude were selected. Aptitude (visual-spatial, depth perception, and psychomotor ability) was measured by previously validated tests. Indicators of technical proficiency for laparoscopic appendectomy were established by trained surgeons with an individual case volume of more than 150. All subjects were tested consecutively on the ProMIS III (Haptica) until they reached predefined proficiency in this procedure. Simulator metrics, critical error scores, and Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) scores were recorded.<br />RESULTS: The mean numbers of attempts to achieve proficiency in performing a laparoscopic appendectomy for group A (high aptitude) and B (low aptitude) were 6 (range 4 to 7) and 14 (range 10 to 18), respectively (p < 0.0001). Significant differences were found between the 2 groups for path length (p = 0.014), error score (p = 0.021), and OSATS score (p < 0.0001) at the initial attempt.<br />CONCLUSIONS: High aptitude is directly related to a rapid attainment of proficiency. These findings suggest that resource allocation for proficiency-based technical training in surgery may need to be tailored according to a trainee's natural ability.","24051067","2013","12"

Women diagnosed with incomplete, missed and empty sac miscarriage were included. The overall rate of successful expectant management was evaluated in terms of symptomatology. The rates of successful expectant management for each miscarriage group were also evaluated in terms of the type of symptoms. Main outcome measure was success of expectant management at two weeks.<br />RESULTS: Spontaneous completion of miscarriage was observed in 76.7% (161/210) women. The overall rates of successful expectant management were significantly different between the symptomatic (79.1%) and asymptomatic (42.9%) groups (P-valueÂ =Â 0.0003).

"1748","Association between Sarcopenia, Bone Density, and Health-Related Quality of Life in Korean Men.","Korean journal of family medicine","BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia is the loss of muscle mass leading to decreased muscle strength, physical disability, and increased mortality. The genesis of both sarcopenia and osteoporosis is multifactorial, and several factors that play a role in osteoporosis are thought to contribute to sarcopenia. This study evaluated the association between sarcopenia and bone density and health-related quality of life in Korean men.<br />METHODS: We used the data of 1,397 men over 50 years of age from the 2009 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Sarcopenia was defined as the appendicular skeletal muscle mass divided by height(2) (kg/m(2)) < 2 standard deviations below the sex-specific mean for young adults. Health-related quality of life was measured by the EuroQol-5 dimension (EQ-5D) instrument. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between sarcopenia, bone density, and health-related quality of life.<br />RESULTS: The T-score of the lumbar spine, total femur, and femur neck in bone mineral density in subjects with sarcopenia were lower than those in subjects without sarcopenia. The score of the EQ-5D index was significantly lower and the rate of having problems with individual components of health-related quality of life was higher in the sarcopenic group. After adjustment for age and body mass index, the odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence interval [CI]) for sarcopenia were 2.06 (1.07-3.96) in osteopenic subjects and 3.49 (1.52-8.02) in osteoporotic subjects, respectively. After adjustment, the total score of the EQ-5D index was significantly lower in the sarcopenic subjects. The ORs (95% CI) for having problems of mobility and usual activity of the EQ-5D descriptive system were 1.70 (1.02-2.84) and 1.90 (1.09-3.31), respectively.<br />CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia was associated with decreased bone mineral density in Korean men. In addition, sarcopenia was related to poor quality of life, especially with regard to mobility and usual activity. Greater attention to and evaluation for sarcopenia are needed in subjects showing low bone mineral density to prevent and manage poor quality of life.","23904958","2013","7"

No objective and reliable method to assess postoperative pain intensity exists till now. The aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals in postoperative pain assessment.<br />METHODS: Thirty patients scheduled for elective abdominal surgery under general anesthesia were examined. Finger PPG signals and visual analogue scale (VAS) score were acquired before and 5, 10, 20, and 30Â min after sufentanil administration when the patients were awake and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). During each pain rating, the patient's blood pressure, heart rate, and pulse oxygen saturation were recorded. The amplitude of alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) extracted from finger PPG signals were analyzed, and the ratio of AC and DC (AC/DC) was calculated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were built to assess the performance of AC and AC/DC to detect patients with VAS >4 in the PACU.<br />RESULTS: After administration of sufentanil, VAS scores decreased significantly (pÂ <Â 0.05), as did blood pressure and heart rate. Simultaneously, both values of AC and AC/DC increased significantly. The VAS score had significant correlations with AC (rÂ =Â -0.477; pÂ <Â 0.01), AC/DC (rÂ =Â -0.738; pÂ <Â 0.01) and heart rate (rÂ =Â 0.280; pÂ <Â 0.01).

Anthropometric measurements, handgrip strength, mobility tests and DEXA were performed. Step by step linear regression models were used to associate ASM from DEXA with anthropometric variables, age and sex. The sample was divided at random into two to obtain prediction equations for both subsamples, which were mutually validated by double cross-validation. The high correlation between the values of observed and predicted MMAE in both sub-samples and the low degree of shrinkage allowed developing the final prediction equation with the total sample.<br />RESULTS: The cross-validity coefficient between prediction models from the subsamples (0.941 and 0.9409) and the shrinkage (0.004 and 0.006) were similar in both equations.

She was investigated on each admission with different diagnoses set each time, but only on her last admission due to persisting symptoms, an MRI scan revealed a tubo-ovarian abscess associated with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). We believe that the PID had developed secondary to the intrauterine device and a few weeks after the removal of the Mirena coil she was diagnosed with a tubo-ovarian abscess. As the case unfolds, we will introduce the possible diagnoses and causes that were likely to have led to the development of the abscess.","22865801","2012",\N

The average age of patients was 59 years. Most frequent causes for incomplete colonoscopy were inadequate preparation (34%), pain (30%), and tortuosity (20%). The scope could not pass the splenic flexure in 165 patients (71%). A total of 218 patients (90%) were offered completion studies, and 179 patients (82%) complied. Seventy-three of 82 patients who had a surveillance colonoscopy had a follow-up (89%), compared with 72 (87%) of 83 with symptoms and 40 (74%) of 54 who had a screening. Barium enema (BE) was performed in 74 (41%), repeat colonoscopy in 71 (40%), CT colonography in 17 (9%), and colonoscopy under general anesthesia in 9 patients (5%). Resection with intraoperative/perioperative colonoscopy was required in 8 patients (4%). Repeat colonoscopy found 32 lesions (24 tubular adenomas, 4 tubulovillous adenomas, and 4 sessile serrated polyps) in 17 patients (24%). Radiology demonstrated new abnormalities in 11 (12%) of 91 patients, prompting 7 colonoscopies. In 3 patients, colonoscopy showed an inverted appendix, a tubulovillous adenoma, and a sigmoid stricture. Overall, clinically significant lesions were found in 19 patients (10%).<br />LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by an incomplete colonoscopy subjectively determined at the time of colonoscopy, as well as by a lack of comparison group.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Complete colonic evaluation in patients with an incomplete colonoscopy is important. Repeat colonoscopy may be the most efficient way to achieve this.","24509464","2014","3"
"1763","A prospective, randomized comparison of long-term outcomes: chronic groin pain and quality of life following totally extraperitoneal (TEP) and transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair.","Surgical endoscopy","BACKGROUND: Data are insufficient to compare transabdominal preperitoneal repair (TAPP) and total extraperitoneal (TEP) techniques of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. There is very scant data comparing the two techniques in terms of long-term outcomes, which include chronic groin pain, quality of life, and time to return to normal activity. This prospective, randomized, controlled trial compared TEP versus TAPP techniques of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair in terms of these long-term outcomes.<br />METHODS: This study was conducted from May 1, 2007 to March 30, 2012. Patients with uncomplicated groin hernia were randomized to transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) or totally extraperitoneal (TEP) techniques. A total of 160 patients were randomized to group I (TEP) and 154 patients to group II (TAPP). Pain was assessed with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) preoperatively and postoperatively at 24 h, 1 week, 6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. Quality of life was assessed with Short Form-36 version 2 (SF 36v2) preoperatively and postoperatively at 3 months follow-up.<br />RESULTS: Demographic, clinical profiles, intraoperative, and early postoperative parameters were well matched. There was significantly higher acute pain following TAPP repair; however, the chronic groin pain was comparable in both TEP and TAPP. Preoperative pain and immediate postoperative pain had significant correlation with chronic groin pain. Significant improvement from preoperative to postoperative quality of life was seen in both TEP and TAPP repairs, but there was no difference between TEP and TAPP in postoperative period. Time to return to normal activity also was similar between the two groups.<br />CONCLUSIONS: The TEP and TAPP techniques of laparoscopic repair of inguinal hernia have comparable long-term outcomes in terms of incidence of chronic groin pain, quality of life, and resumption of normal activities. Chronic groin pain had a significant correlation with preoperative pain and early postoperative pain. However, TAPP was associated with significantly higher incidence of early postoperative pain, longer operative time, and cord edema, whereas TEP was associated with a significant higher incidence of seroma formation. The cost was comparable between the two.","23389072","2013","7"
"1764","Muscle strength, muscle mass, and physical disability in women with systemic lupus erythematosus.","Arthritis care & research","OBJECTIVE: Data describing relationships between muscle strength, muscle mass, and physical disability among individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are limited. The present study examines the relationship of muscle strength and muscle mass with physical disability among adult women with SLE.<br />METHODS: A total of 146 women from a longitudinal SLE cohort participated in the study. All measures were collected during an in-person research visit. Lower extremity muscle strength was assessed by peak knee torque of extension and flexion and by chair-stand time. Total lean body mass, appendicular lean mass, and fat mass (kg/m(2) ) were measured by whole-body dual x-ray absorptiometry. Self-reported physical disability was assessed using the Short Form 36 health survey (SF-36) physical functioning subscale, and the Valued Life Activities (VLA) disability scale. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients tested the correlations between muscle strength, muscle mass, and disability scores. Regression analyses modeled the effect of lower extremity muscle strength and mass on SF-36 and VLA disability scores controlling for age, SLE duration, SLE disease activity measured with the Systemic Lupus Activity Questionnaire, physical activity level, prednisone use, body composition, and depression.<br />RESULTS: On all measures, reduced lower extremity muscle strength was associated with poorer SF-36 and VLA disability scores. Trends persisted after adjustment for covariates. Muscle mass was moderately correlated with muscle strength, but did not contribute significantly to adjusted regression models.<br />CONCLUSION: Lower extremity muscle strength, but not muscle mass, was strongly associated with physical disability scores. While further studies are needed, these findings suggest that improving muscle strength may reduce physical disability among women with SLE.","25049114","2015","1"

Most of the times, it is difficult to establish the diagnosis, as symptoms are not specific. Few cases have been reported in the literature.<br />CASE PRESENTATION: A 52-year-old Caucasian woman presented with abdominal pain, vomiting and weakness nine days after arthroplasty and heparin use. Hyperkalemia, low cortisol and high adrenocorticotropic hormone levels were found, indicating adrenal insufficiency. Magnetic resonance imaging of the upper abdomen was compatible with preceding adrenal haemorrhage. Hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone were administered. Review of the literature revealed 36 cases of postoperative adrenal haemorrhage which are presented briefly.<br />CONCLUSION: Postoperative acute adrenal insufficiency due to haemorrhage is a rare condition. If patients are treated based on clinical suspicion, they have good chances to survive. Hydrocortisone is given permanently in the majority of the patients.","24028157","2013",\N

The aim of this study was to determine the capability of an inanimate laparoscopic appendectomy model to discriminate between different levels of surgical experience (construct validity).<br />METHODS: The performance of 3 groups with different levels of expertise in laparoscopic surgery--experts (Group A), intermediates (Group B), and novices (Group C)--was evaluated. The groups were instructed of the task to perform in the model using a video tutorial. Procedures were recorded in a digital format for later analysis using the Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills (GOALS) score; procedure time was registered. The data were analyzed using the analysis of variance test.<br />RESULTS: Twelve subjects were evaluated, 4 in each group, using the GOALS score and time required to finish the task. Higher scores were observed in the expert group, followed by the intermediate and novice groups, with statistically significant difference. Regarding procedure time, a significant difference was also found between the groups, with the experts having the shorter time. The proposed model is able to discriminate among individuals with different levels of expertise, indicating that the abilities that the model evaluates are relevant in the surgeon's performance.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Construct validity for the inanimate full-task laparoscopic appendectomy training model was demonstrated. Therefore, it is a useful tool in the development and evaluation of the resident in training.","24018084",\N,\N

Rates of treatment failure, recurrence, and perforation after nonsurgical management were calculated. Factors associated with treatment failure, recurrence, and perforation were identified using multivariable logistic regression. Mortality, length of stay, and total charges were compared between treatment cohorts using matched propensity score analysis.<br />RESULTS: Of 231,678 patients with uncomplicated appendicitis, the majority (98.5%) were managed operatively. Of the 3,236 nonsurgically managed patients who survived to discharge without an interval appendectomy, 5.9% and 4.4% experienced treatment failure or recurrence, respectively, during a median follow-up of more than 7 years. There were no mortalities associated with treatment failure or recurrence. The risk of perforation after discharge was approximately 3%. Using multivariable analysis, race and age were significantly associated with the odds of treatment failure. Sex, age, and hospital teaching status were significantly associated with the odds of recurrence. Age and hospital teaching status were significantly associated with the odds of perforation. Matched propensity score analysis indicated that after risk adjustment, mortality rates (0.1% vs 0.3%; p = 0.65) and total charges ($23,243 vs $24,793; p = 0.70) were not statistically different between operative and nonoperative patients; however, length of stay was significantly longer in the nonoperative treatment group (2.1 days vs 3.2 days; p < 0.001).<br />CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that nonoperative management of uncomplicated appendicitis can be safe and prompts additional investigations. Comparative effectiveness research using prospective randomized studies can be particularly useful.","24661850","2014","5"

"1772","Pheochromocytoma found in takotsubo cardiomyopathy patients.","The Journal of invasive cardiology","Increased level of serum catecholamines in the acute phase was reported to be a feature of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC). We report a TC case with pheochromocytoma, which caused a stir in the diagnosis of TC and suggests the importance of screening for a catecholamine-producing tumor. A female patient was referred to our emergency department due to ongoing chest pain. Coronary angiography showed no abnormality; however, subsequent left ventriculography showed basal hyperkinesis and apical ballooning, which completely recovered in 2 weeks. She experienced significant emotional stress on the eve of her admission, to which the diagnosis of TC was attributed. Although serum catecholamine levels on admission in our case were higher than on day 14, the value on day 14 was much higher than the normal range in our patient. The screening abdominal computed tomography scan revealed a left adrenal mass, which was diagnosed as pheochromocytoma by 24-hour urinary excretion of catecholamine and (131)I-MIBG scintigraphy. The mass was successfully resected and pathological findings supported the diagnosis. In our case, emotional stress was thought to be the direct trigger to develop TC by exceeding the threshold of catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy. Screening for a catecholamine-producing tumor through careful history-taking and measuring catecholamines at a follow-up stage were important clinical aspects in this case and may well be for others.","24907091","2014","6"

The pain management in these patients is often challenging.<br />OBJECTIVES: To investigate the most effective dose of morphine with the least side effects in emergency renal colic patients.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: 150 renal colic patients who experienced a pain level of 4 or greater, based on visual analog scale (VAS) at admission time were included. Pain was scored on a 100 mm VAS (0 = no pain, 100 = the worst pain imagined). When patients arrived at ED, a physician would examine the patients and assessed initial pain score, then filled a questionnaire according to the patient information. Patients were assigned to receive 2.5 mg morphine sulfate intravenously. We monitored patients' visual analog scale (VAS), and adverse events at different time points (every 15 minutes) for 90 minutes. Additional doses of intravenous morphine (2.5 mg) were administered if the patient still had pain. (Max dose: 10 mg). The cumulative dose of morphine, defined as the total amount of morphine prescribed to each patient during the 90 minutes of the study, was recorded. Patients were not permitted to use any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as coadjuvant analgesics during the study period. Subjects with inadequate pain relief at 90 minutes received rescue morphine and were excluded from the study. The primary end point in this study was pain relief at 90 minutes, defined as either VAS<40 or decrease of 50% or more as compared to the initial VAS. The secondary objective was to detect the occurrence of adverse effects at any time points in ED.<br />RESULTS: The studied patients consisted of 104 men and 46 women with the mean age of 43 Â±14 years (range, 18 to 75 years). There was no statistically significant difference between the mean age and gender differences in pain response. Rescue analgesia at 30 minutes were given in 54.5% receiving morphine. The average time to painless was 35 minutes. But there were no statistically significant differences between the mean age and gender differences in pain response (P > 0.05). Older patients responded sooner to morphine than the young. Most of the patients had a pain score of 90 -100 (77.3 %) at the beginning that was reduced to 29.4% during the 30 minutes follow up. During the first hour, we found that 94.7% of the patients had no pain or significant pain reduction and only 2.1% of the patients still had pain.<br />CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that there were no significant differences among the gender, time of admission and side - effects in renal colic patients in response to morphine.","24350118","2012",\N
"1774","Ulcerative colitis flair induced by mesalamine suppositories hypersensitivity.","World journal of gastroenterology : WJG","Mesalamine suppositories have been used widely for the treatment of distal ulcerative colitis and considered to be safer than systemic administration for its limited systemic absorption.

Here we present a 25-year-old woman with ulcerative colitis with bloody diarrhea accompanied by abdominal pain and fever which were aggravated after introduction of mesalamine suppositories. In light of symptom exacerbation of ulcerative colitis, increased inflammatory injury of colon mucosa shown by colonoscopy and elevated peripheral eosinophil count after mesalamine suppositories administration, and the Naranjo algorithm score of 10, the possibility of hypersensitivity reaction to mesalamine suppositories should be considered, warning us to be aware of this potential reaction after administration of mesalamine formulations even if it is the suppositories.","24707159","2014","4"
"1775","Chronic pain after childbirth.","International journal of obstetric anesthesia","With over four million deliveries annually in the United States alone and a constant increase in cesarean delivery rate, childbirth is likely to have a huge impact on the occurrence of acute and possibly chronic postpartum pain. Recent awareness that chronic pain may occur after childbirth has prompted clinicians and researchers to investigate this topic. Current evidence points towards a relatively low incidence of chronic pain after cesarean delivery, with rates ranging between 1% and 18%. To provide a potential mechanistic explanation for the relatively low occurrence of chronic pain after cesarean delivery compared with that after other types of surgery, it has been proposed that endogenous secretion of oxytocin may confer specific protection. Clinical interventions to reduce the incidence and severity of chronic post-surgical pain have not been consistently effective. Likely explanations are that the drugs that have been investigated were truly ineffective or that the effect was too modest because with a low incidence of chronic pain, studies were likely to be underpowered and failed to demonstrate an effect. In addition, since not all women require preventive therapies, preoperative testing that may identify women vulnerable to pain may be highly beneficial. Further research is needed to identify valid models that predict persistent pain to allow targeted interventions to women most likely to benefit from more tailored anti-hyperalgesic therapies.","23477888","2013","4"

The aim of this retrospective clinical study is to emphasize two different methods (metal clip and Hem-o-lok(Â®) [Teleflex Medical, Research Triangle Park, NC] clip) for CAS.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cases were divided into two subgroups according to the type of CAS. Subgroups were compared with each other according to age, intraabdominal abscess formation, operation duration, and complication rate.<br />RESULTS: No intraoperative complications were seen in either subgroup. There were 22 postoperative complications in the metal clip subgroup (13 intraabdominal abscesses, 9 wound infections) and 8 postoperative complications in the Hem-o-lok clip subgroup (five intraabdominal abscesses, three wound infections). The cost of the closure was $7 for the metal clip group and $50 for the Hem-o-lok clip group.<br />CONCLUSIONS: The use of Hem-o-lok clips and metal clip for CAS in laparoscopic appendectomy is a feasible, safe, and cost-effective procedure in patients with a mild to moderately inflamed appendix base of less than 10â€‰mm in diameter.","25007288","2014","8"

The applied surgical procedure was laparoscopy with 1065 patients (87.73%) and the open technique with 149 patients (12.27%). Since January 2006 our main principle has been that in case of appendicitis the primary technique to be applied is laparoscopic appendectomy. We were forced to conversion with 16.5% of patients and as the operational experience of the department grows, the proportion of conversions tends to decrease.<br />CONCLUSION: The advantages of laparoscopic appendectomy as opposed to open surgery have become obvious in the past decade, and the procedure may be recommended for all age groups. In case acute appendicitis is suspected the primary procedure to be applied in our department is the laparoscopic operation, the results of which are at least as good as that of open appendectomy. The routine application of laparoscopic appendectomy provides an excellent basis for the acquisition of advanced laparoscopic surgery thus appendectomy will not lose its training character due to the laparoscopic approach.","24333975","2013","12"

One of these methods is ubiquitous in applications of finite mixture regression, whereas the other method is an alternative that appears not to have been used so far. The two methods are compared in two simulation studies and on an illustrative data set. The results show that the alternative method yields solutions with likelihood values at least as high as, and often higher than, those returned by the standard method. Moreover, analyses of the illustrative data set show that the results obtained by the two methods may differ considerably with regard to some of the substantive conclusions. The results reported in this article indicate that in applications of finite mixture regression, consideration should be given to the type of mechanism chosen to generate random starting values for the EM algorithm.

BamHI M rightward reading frame (BMRF)-1, EBNA-1 and BamHI Z leftward reading frame (BZLF)-1-mRNA were intermittently expressed in PBMCs. In 1 infected rabbit with continuous detection of EBV-DNA in PBMCs, many EBER-1-positive lymphocytes were observed in germinal centers and/or marginal zones in some follicles of the appendix, and for the first time a lymphocyte with EBER-1 expression infiltrating in the squamous cell layer of the tonsils was found.

"1787","Preclinical high-dose acetaminophen with N-acetylcysteine rescue enhances the efficacy of cisplatin chemotherapy in atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors.","Pediatric blood & cancer","BACKGROUND: Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (AT-RT) are pediatric tumors of the central nervous system with limited treatment options and poor survival rate. We investigated whether enhancing chemotherapy toxicity by depleting intracellular glutathione (GSH; a key molecule in cisplatin resistance) with high dose acetaminophen (AAP), may improve therapeutic efficacy in AT-RT in vitro.<br />PROCEDURE: BT16 (cisplatin-resistant) and BT12 (cisplatin-sensitive) AT-RT cell lines were treated with combinations of AAP, cisplatin, and the anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Cell viability, GSH and peroxide concentrations, mitochondrial damage, and apoptosis were evaluated in vitro.<br />RESULTS: AAP enhanced cisplatin cytotoxicity in cisplatin-resistant BT16 cells but not cisplatin-sensitive BT12 cells. Baseline GSH levels were elevated in BT16 cells compared to BT12 cells, and AAP decreased GSH to a greater magnitude in BT16 cells than BT12 cells. Unlike BT12 cells, BT16 cells did not have elevated peroxide levels upon treatment with cisplatin alone, but did have elevated levels when treated with AAP + cisplatin. Both cell lines had markedly increased mitochondrial injury when treated with AAP + cisplatin relative to either drug treatment alone. The enhanced toxic effects were partially reversed with concurrent administration of NAC.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that AAP could be used as a chemo-enhancement agent to potentiate cisplatin chemotherapeutic efficacy particularly in cisplatin-resistant AT-RT tumors with high GSH levels in clinical settings.","23956023","2014","1"
"1788","Pre-operative tumour marker status predicts recurrence and survival after complete cytoreduction and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy for appendiceal Pseudomyxoma Peritonei: Analysis of 519 patients.","European journal of surgical oncology : the journal of the European Society of Surgical Oncology and the British Association of Surgical Oncology","BACKGROUND: Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) combined with Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) is the optimal treatment for Pseudomyxoma Peritonei (PMP). Despite treatment, disease often recurs and may not be amenable to further CRS. Clinical experience suggests a spectrum of disease which may correlate with tumour marker levels. The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of markers on recurrence and survival.<br />METHODS: The details of all patients undergoing surgery for PMP of appendiceal origin at a national centre for peritoneal malignancy were recorded in a dedicated prospective database. The data on all patients who had CRS and HIPEC between March 1994 and January 2012 was analysed and recurrence and survival correlated with pre-operative levels of CEA, CA-125 and CA19-9.<br />RESULTS: Overall, 519 (69%) of 752 consecutive patients, underwent complete CRS and HIPEC. The median (range) age was 56 (20-82) years with 342/519 (66%) females. The mean overall (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) in the 131/519 patients who had normal preoperative tumour markers was 168 (128-207) and 125 (114-136) months respectively, significantly higher when compared with the 109/519 (21%) who had all three tumour markers elevated (OS of 65 (42-88) and DFS of 55 (41-70) months respectively) (P = 0.002).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Elevated tumour markers predict an increased risk of recurrence and reduced survival after complete CRS. This may reflect cell biology in low grade tumours and is an independent prognostic feature. Further analysis may help to select patients for post-operative chemotherapy, second look procedures or stratification of follow up.","24462284","2014","5"

Optimal utilization of the available resources is essential for improving pain management.<br />AIMS: The aim of our study was to determine pain management strategies employed after major abdominal surgeries at our institute and their efficacy and safety.<br />SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Prospective observational study conducted at a tertiary care hospital.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing elective major abdominal surgeries were included. Post-operative analgesic strategy, co-analgesics used, pain and sedation scores, motor block, nausea and vomiting were recorded and patient satisfaction was determined.<br />RESULTS: Data was collected on 100 patients. Epidural analgesia was used in 61, patient controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) in 25 and opioid infusion in 14 patients. Multimodal analgesia was employed in 98 patients. The level of epidural was between L1-L3 in 31, T10-L1 in 20 and T8-T10 in 10 patients. Pethidine was used in 80% of patients receiving PCIA. Patients with epidurals at T8-T10 had lower pain scores. Fifteen patients had motor block, 73% of which were with epidural at L1-L3. Fourteen patients complained of nausea. Ninety nine out of 100 patients were satisfied with their analgesia.<br />CONCLUSION: Epidural, PCIA and opioid infusions are used for pain relief after major abdominal surgeries at our hospital. Although there is limited drug availability, regular assessments and appropriate dose adjustments by acute pain management service (APMS) and use of multimodal analgesia led to a high level of patient satisfaction. We recommend that feedback to the primary anesthesiologists by APMS is of utmost importance to enable improvement in practice.","24249983","2013","10"

Publications were included if they were clinical trials randomizing patients with appendicitis to SILA or CLA. Outcome measures evaluated included operating time, length of hospital stay, total postoperative complications, and, specifically, wound infection, intra-abdominal collection and ileus. Weighted mean difference was calculated for the effect size of SILA on continuous variables, and pooled odds ratios were calculated for discrete variables.<br />RESULTS: The literature search identified seven randomized clinical trials that met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. In total, 1108 appendicectomies were included, 555 SILA and 553 CLA procedures. There were no significant differences between the groups in the incidence of total postoperative complications, wound infection, intra-abdominal collection, ileus or length of hospital stay. However, SILA was associated with a significantly longer operating time compared with CLA (weighted mean difference 6Â·96 (95 per cent confidence interval 3Â·79 to 10Â·12)â€‰min; Pâ€‰<â€‰0Â·001). Insertion of an additional port was required in 7Â·6 per cent of patients undergoing SILA.<br />CONCLUSION: SILA is a safe procedure for the treatment of acute appendicitis, with comparable clinical outcome to CLA when undertaken by experienced laparoscopic surgeons.","24227355","2013","12"
"1792","Surgical training: design of a virtual care pathway approach.","Surgery","BACKGROUND: Both intra- and perioperative care are essential for patients' safety. Training for intraoperative technical skills on simulators and for perioperative care in virtual patients have independently demonstrated educational value, but no training combining these 2 approaches has been designed yet. The aim of this study was to design a pathway approach for training in general surgery. A common disease requiring essential skills was chosen, namely, acute appendicitis.<br />METHODS: Preoperative care training was created using virtual patients presenting with acute right iliac fossa (RIF) pain. A competency-based curriculum for laparoscopic appendectomy (LAPP) was designed on a virtual reality simulator: Novices (<10 LAPP) and experienced surgeons (>100 LAPP) were enrolled to perform 2 virtual LAPP for assessment of validity evidence; novices performed 8 further LAPP for analysis of a learning curve. Finally, postoperative virtual patients were reviewed after LAPP.<br />RESULTS: Four preoperative patient scenarios were designed with different presentations of RIF; not all required operative management. Comments were provided through case progression to allow autonomous practice. Ten novices and 10 experienced surgeons were enrolled for intraoperative training. Time taken (median values) of novices versus experienced surgeons (285 vs 259Â seconds; PÂ =Â .026) and performance score (67% vs 99%; PÂ <Â .0001) demonstrated evidence for validity, whereas path length did not (916 vs 673Â cm; PÂ =Â .113).

"1793","First 100 laparoscopic surgeries in a predominantly rural Nigerian population: a template for future growth.","World journal of surgery","BACKGROUND: Minimal access surgery has revolutionized surgery practice. Its proven advantages, such as reduced postoperative pain, early return to unrestricted activities, and better cosmesis, have become important drivers for its rapid development. In sub-Saharan Africa this development has been slow. The aim of the current study was to describe the challenges and outcomes of laparoscopic procedures in a public hospital that caters to a predominantly rural population.<br />MATERIAL AND METHODS: The first 100 patients who underwent laparoscopic procedure in the Department of Surgery at Federal Medical Centre, Owerri, Nigeria were retrospectively analyzed. Data were retrieved from the medical records department as well as the surgical theater procedure register. The focus of the study was on patient demographics, indication for surgery, procedure performed, length of hospital stay, and morbidity and mortality data. Staff training was done locally and abroad.<br />RESULTS: Altogether, 100 patients had laparoscopic surgery in our general surgery unit from September 2007 through July 2013. The ages of the patients was 5-75 years (median 36.5 years). The three main procedures were cholecystectomy (36 %), diagnostic laparoscopy (29 %), and appendectomy (21 %). The other operations performed included liver abscess drainage (7 %), adhesiolysis (3 %), hernia repair (1 %), and Heller's myotomy (1 %). Four cases were converted to open surgery. There were no deaths. There were 14 grades I and II postoperative complications in nine patients.<br />CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that basic laparoscopic procedures could be offered safely to our resource-poor rural population. It is a platform on which we can hopefully introduce advanced laparoscopic surgical operations.","24898936","2014","11"
"1794","Laparoscopic appendectomy for chronic right lower quadrant abdominal pain.","International journal of colorectal disease","PURPOSE: The appendix can be a rare cause for chronic right lower quadrant abdominal pain (RLQAP), even though no objective disorder can be determined to the appendix. This condition can be described as chronic appendicitis or (neurogenic) appendicopathy. After careful selection, elective appendectomy is performed in our centre for this group of patients.<br />METHODS: All patients that underwent an elective appendectomy between 2006 and 2013 were prospectively analysed. Inclusion criterion was chronic RLQAP without abnormalities seen on imaging. Exclusion criterion was pain after conservative treatment of (complicated) appendicitis or an abnormal appendix on imaging like a mass, mucocoele or faecolith. Primary outcome was the effect on the pain postoperatively.<br />RESULTS: In the period of the study, ten patients met the inclusion criteria and underwent an appendectomy for chronic RLQAP. Average preoperative pain score assessed with visual analogue scale (VAS) was 8.6. Preoperative work-up showed no abnormalities. No macroscopic abnormalities were seen during surgery in any of the patients. Histopathological analysis was obtained and showed limited abnormalities in eight of ten patients, mostly suspicion of previous inflammation. Postoperatively, no complications occurred, and at revision after 3 weeks, average VAS was 1.0. Long-term follow-up showed that patients remained free of symptoms; average VAS after a median of 33 months was 1.0.<br />CONCLUSIONS: A significant reduction of pain was achieved after an appendectomy in all patients suffering from chronic RLQAP in this series. Seven out of ten patients were completely free of pain.","25060220","2014","10"
"1795","[State of dementia due to intermittent acute porphyria: a case report].","L'EncÃ©phale","INTRODUCTION: Porphyrias are rare inherited disorders due to specific enzyme abnormalities of heme biosynthesis. We can classify them as hepatic or erythropoÃ¯etic, the type depends on the organ in which the enzyme is deficient. Among the hepatic forms, three of them are clinically characterised by acute abdominal pain and neuropathy, sometimes associated with psychiatric disorders.<br />CASE REPORT: This 58-year-old woman has been hospitalized frequently since 1995 with depression, apathy, or for suicide attempts. She has a history of alcohol addiction and since 1992 suffers from non-insulin dependant diabetes. She had been treated by benzodiazepines and neuroleptic medication for several years. Psychiatric examination revealed persecution and megalomania delirium associated with a Capgras syndrome, confusion, disorientation, depression and blunted affect. Results of neurologic examination showed reduced deep tendon reflexes, and nerve conduction revealed sensitive neuropathy. Moreover, she lay down, remained non-responsive and resisted care. The whole clinical picture evoked early dementia. Coloured urine was noticed and porphyria tested. When the diagnosis of intermittent acute porphyria was made, she gradually improved by stopping the drugs not indicated for the case, and by treating her diabetes. A few months later, while hospitalized for a similar episode, she choked on her food and died, probably caused by autonomic neuropathy.<br />DISCUSSION: Our hypothesis was that chronic and debilitating psychopathology may be due to acute intermittent porphyria. Probably, among patients treated for psychiatric illness, some of them may suffer from this enzyme abnormality. Above all, the psychopathology associated with intermittent acute porphyria is polymorphous such as atypical psychosis, schizoaffective disorder, depression, apathetic withdrawal, and in this case report dementia. In like manner, organic manifestations are numerous and varied, leading to erroneous diagnosis. We suspect that patients with porphyria are common among mentally ill subjects. Do we have to test all our psychiatric patients for porphyria? It seems that the prevalence of intermittent acute porphyria in the psychiatric patient population is 0.21%, whereas the prevalence in the normal population is from 0.001 to 0.002%.<br />CONCLUSION: The early detection of porphyria may diminish morbidity and mortality rates, and perhaps heal some chronic atypical psychiatric illnesses.","23993340","2014","9"

The relationship between clinic-pathological characteristics and prognosis were analyzed using log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model.<br />RESULTS: (1) Clinicopathologic features: the mean age of the 48 cases was 58.8 years (range from 24 to 79 years).<br />SYMPTOMS: abdominal distention and abdominal discomfort were the main symptoms. Imaging examinations showed nonspecific abdominal and pelvic lesions in most cases.<br />TREATMENT: all the 48 patients underwent laparotomy and cytoreductive surgery (CRS), in which 15(31%) patients with completeness of the cancer resection (CCR) -1, 24(50%) cases with CCR-2, and CCR-3 in 9(19%) cases. Six (12%) cases were treated by intraoperative hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) with cisplatin, 20(42%) patients were treated with different options postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Pathological types:the cases were histologically classified into 3 subcategories:disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis (DPAM), peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis (PMCA), and PMCA with intermediate or discordant features (PMCA-I/D), which were 22(46%) cases, 9 (19%)cases and 17 (35%)cases, respectively. Appendiceal tumors: 44(92%) cases underwent appendectomy, in which 38 cases presented appendiceal tumors (including 20 cases of low-grade appendiceal mucinous adenoma and 18 cases of appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma), 2 cases were diagnosed as appendicitis, 4 cases with unknown pathologic diagnosis. And the other 4(8%) cases, who didn't undergo appendectomy at the first operation, presented peritoneal tumor recurrence and appendiceal mucinous tumors 1, 11, 32 and 85 months after surgery, respectively. Parenchymal organs involved: ovarian involving was happened in 34 (71%) patients including 15 cases with the right ovary involving, 13 cases in both sides, and 6 cases involving the left side. The other parenchymal organs in 10(21%) cases. (2) Prognostic factors: 11 patients died, 31 survived and 6 cases were lost to follow-up. The mean survival time was 99 months(ranged from 1 to 312 months). The 3-year, 5-year and 10-year survival rates were 73.3%, 68.0% and 46.6%, respectively. Univariate statistical analysis showed that age, pathological type and parenchymal involvement were significantly relationship with the survival time (all P < 0.05). But the operation times, appendiceal tumor type, ovarian involvement, CCR, intraperitoneal HIPEC and post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy were not significantly correlate with survival time (all P > 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that age and pathologic type were independent prognostic factors(P < 0.05).<br />CONCLUSIONS: No specific clinical features presented in PMP. CRS with HIPEC should the recommended treatment. Both ovaries exploration and appendectomy should be carried out routinely in CRS. The 10-year overall survival of PMP is low. Age, pathological type and parenchymal organs involvement other than ovarian are correlated with the prognosis. And the pathological type and age are independent prognostic factors of PMP.","24199925","2013","8"

Two surgical oncologists blindly analyzed all abdominopelvic CT scans.<br />RESULTS: PCI estimated on imaging was not higher in unresectable patients (P = .851) and significantly underestimated intraoperative PCI measurement (P = .003). No single concerning feature was associated with unresectability. However, patients with 2 or more concerning features were more likely to be unresectable (87.5% vs 36.4%, P = .035).<br />CONCLUSIONS: Two or more concerning CT imaging features appear to be associated with a higher risk of unresectability in patients with PC.

Vertebral artery injuries have a high association with specific cervical fractures including atlanto-axial fractures, displaced fracture patterns, and transverse foramen fractures. Optimal medical management of the occluded vertebral artery has yet to be determined; however, there is an extremely high complication rate with systemic anticoagulation in these patients. Furthermore, unlike appendicular skeleton fracture-dislocations with vascular injury, there is no clear consensus as to the optimal acute management of the displaced odontoid fracture with or without vertebral artery injury.<br />METHODS: We report on a severely displaced odontoid fracture that was found to have a vertebral artery injury. Medical records and imaging were reviewed.<br />RESULTS: An 82-year-old female presented to our hospital with a type IIb odontoid fracture after sustaining a ground-level fall. Pertinent physical exam findings were ecchymosis on the left side of her forehead and posterior cervical pain without neurologic deficits. An MRA showed an occluded left vertebral artery. The patient was placed in early cervical traction and the fracture was reduced within 12 h of presentation. Following surgical stabilization, an MR angiogram showed complete reperfusion of the vertebral artery without intimal tear.<br />CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of a displaced odontoid fracture in which cervical traction was used to restore the perfusion of the vertebral artery. Cervical traction may obviate the need for systemic anticoagulation and should be considered in patients who have an identifiable compression of the vertebral artery even if neurologically intact.","23989680","2013","10"

"1804","Concordance of measures of left-ventricular hypertrophy in pediatric hypertension.","Pediatric cardiology","The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that any child diagnosed with hypertension have an echocardiogram to evaluate for the presence of left-ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH) and advocates that LVH is an indication to initiate or intensify antihypertensive therapy. However, there is no consensus on the ideal method of defining LVH in the pediatric population. Many pediatric cardiologists rely on wall-thickness z-score of the LV posterior wall and/or interventricular septum to determine LVH. Yet, the AAP advocates using LV mass indexed to 2.7 (LVMI(2.7)) â‰¥ 51 g/m(2.7) to diagnose LVH. Recently, age-specific reference values for LVMI â‰¥ 95% were developed. The objective of the study was to determine the concordance between diagnosis of LVH by wall-thickness z-score and diagnosis by LVMI(2.7) criteria. A retrospective chart review was performed for subjects diagnosed with hypertension at a single tertiary care center (2009-2012). Echocardiogram reports were reviewed, and assessment of LVH was recorded. Diagnosis of LVH was assigned to each report reviewed according to three criteria: (1) LV wall-thickness z-score > 2.00; (2) age-specific reference values for LVMI(2.7) > 95th percentile; and (3) LVMI(2.7) > 51 g/m(2.7). Cohen's kappa statistic was used as a measurement of agreement between diagnosis by wall-thickness z-score and diagnosis using LVMI(2.7). A total of 159 echocardiograms in 109 subjects were reviewed. Subjects included 31 females and 77 males, age 13.2 Â± 4.4 years, and 39 (42%) with a diagnosis of secondary hypertension. LVH was diagnosed in 31 cases (20%) based on increased wall-thickness z-score. Using LVMI(2.7) > 95%, LVH was found in 75 (47%) cases (mean LVMI(2.7)42.3 Â± 17.2 g/m(2.7) [range 11.0-111 g/m(2.7)]). The wall-thickness z-score method agreed with LVMI(2.7) > 95% diagnosis 71% of the time (kappa 0.4). Using LVH criteria of LVMI(2.7) â‰¥ 51 g/m(2.7), 33 (21%) subjects were diagnosed with LVH. There was 79% agreement in the diagnosis of LVH between the wall-thickness z-score method and LVMI(2.7) > 51 g/m(2.7) (kappa 0.37). There is poor concordance between the diagnosis of LVH on echocardiogram reports using wall-thickness z-score and diagnosis of LVH using LVMI(2.7) criteria. It is important to establish a consensus method for diagnosing LVH because of the high frequency of cardiovascular complications in children with hypertension.","24253610","2014","4"

Two days later, he developed cutaneous lesions consisting of tender, erythematous, and violaceous papules and nodules scattered over his legs, soles, and upper extremities. Laboratory studies revealed neutrophilia, microcytic anemia, and elevation of both erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein rate. A skin biopsy specimen showed deep dermal and predominantly septal inflammatory infiltrate in the subcutaneous tissue composed of polymorphonuclears, eosinophils, and mononuclear cells of histiocytic appearance. These histiocytoid cells stained positive for myeloperoxidase. Subcutaneous Sweet syndrome is a rare subtype of acute neutrophilic dermatosis, in which the infiltrate is exclusively or predominantly located in the subcutaneous tissue, causing lobular or septal panniculitis. It is often described in patients with an underlying haematological disorder or caused by drugs, but very rare in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, especially in childhood or adolescence.
